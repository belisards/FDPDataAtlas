In these locations, large populations of refugee-returnees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities live together. Within these PARR locations, UNHCR implemented its short and medium-term Community-based Protection and Solutions Programme Response (CO-PROSPER) programmes to promote long-term development initiatives. UNHCR aimed to develop an area-based, humanitarian-development-peace triple nexus response to support durable solutions and create conducive conditions for the sustainable reintegration of displaced persons.
To understand the impact of these programmes on the PARR locations, IMPACT Initiatives (IMPACT) conducted an evaluation of the impact of the programmes in PARR locations across four different dimensions: 1) community leadership inclusivity, 2) strengthening public services and equitable access, 3) income generation and economic empowerment, and 4) peacebuilding, and created indices to measure progress over these four key objectives that can be compared against the programme goals. 
In order to conduct this assessment, a mixed-method approach was used with two structured tools with separate methodologies to assess each site as follows. 
A HH level tool was used to interview a representative sample of HHs in each of the 20 PARR locations, with a 95% confidence level and a 10% margin of error.

Most of these impacts are related to the direct health effect, but also to the containment measures that systematically altered socio-economic activities, resulting in a reduction of income across the board. Due to the urgent need for timely data and the limits on face-to-face surveys, the World Bank and the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD) decided to implement a high-frequency phone survey of national households (HFPS) (https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3768) to monitor the effects of COVID-19 on households, leveraging the available household phone number in the 2018/19 Enquete Harmonisée sur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages (EHCVM). 
In Burkina Faso, the forcibly displaced persons (FDP) include both refugees and internal displaced population. For security related issues, FDPs are predominantly internal displaced people (IDPs). According to recent studies, the number of internally displaced people soared from 87,000 in January 2019 to over 1 million in August 2020, an increase of more than 1000 per cent (Conseil National de Secours d'Urgence et de Réhabilitation – CONASUR, 2020). The unprecedented levels of displacement occurred as the coronavirus pandemic worsens an already critical humanitarian crisis in the violence-stricken country. This critical situation calls for the need of timely data and analysis especially during a pandemic for this vulnerable group in order to better inform policy and targeting programs. Given the mutual interest of the INSD, WB-UNHCR Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement (JDC), UNHCR, and World Bank, decision was made to further expand the sample of the high-frequency phone survey of national households (HFPS) to include IDPs for a total of three consecutive rounds. 
The core survey questionnaire of the Burkina Faso High Frequency Phone Survey on IDPs (BFA HFPS-IDP) is designed to cover important and relevant topics like employment, access to basic services and items, and non-labor sources of income. The core questionnaire is complemented by questions on selected topics that rotate each month, including knowledge of Covid-19 spread, social distancing and behavior, coping mechanisms to shocks, fragility, conflict and violence. Selected topics may be investigated more in detail in specific rounds.

The BFA HFPS-IDP is fielded alongside the Burkina Faso Covid-19 High Frequency Phone Survey of national households. Rounds 1, 2 and 3 of data collection for the HFPS-IDP occur simultaneously with round 9, 10 and 11 of the national HFPS operation, respectively.",2021-05-03-2021-05-23; 2021-05-25-2021-06-17; 2021-06-28-2021-07-2,"- Households

The CONASUR has been developed and supported by the government of Burkina Faso with the technical and financial support of development partners, including UNHCR, IOM and OCHA. The CONASUR database is updated regularly, and has exhaustive list of refugees and IDPs, along with few socio-demographic characteristics, as well as information on the phone numbers of households. The sample is drawn from the 9 regions (out of 12) where the presence of IDPs is more relevant: Boucle du Mouhoun, Cascades, Centre-Est, Centre-Nord, Est, Hauts-Bassins, Nord, Plateau Central, Sahel. It is important to note that the BFA HFPS-IDPs is representative of households that have access to phones. Taken that into consideration, a key concern is the bias introduced by sampling households with at least a phone number, as phone penetration in some regions/areas might be limited. However, according to data from the CONASUR database, the percentage of households with at least one phone number is very high, accounting for above the 74% in all the sampled regions.

To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), which outlines eight steps, of which we follow six, to construct the sampling weights for the BFA-HFPS:
1. Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on household characteristics as well as the characteristics of the dwelling. While the CONASUR database is limited in the number of socioeconomic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the CONASUR database.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

It is a representative survey of the post-2017 population of displaced Rohingya and households in host communities in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh.

The high-frequency phone tracking (HFT) surveys were built to maintain communication with baseline respondents while collecting rapid data on key welfare indicators on labor, basic needs and education. Three rounds of the HFT have been completed between 2020-2021, which have been used to produce welfare updates on the host and Rohingya population residing in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, particularly amidst the COVID-19 crisis.

Round 1 collected information on labor and access to basic needs only; the module on education was added Round 2 onwards.",2020-04-2020-05; 2020-10-2020-12; 2021-04-2021-0,Households and individuals,Cox's Bazar district and some parts of Bandarban district.,Sample survey data [ssd],"The CBPS High Frequency Phone Tracking Surveys collected follow-up information on key household and individual welfare indicators, broadly across three dimensions: labor, access to basic needs and education status of school-aged children. The surveys collect standard indicators across both Rohingya and host populations. However, it should be noted that camps operate under different policy regulations compared to hosts, and as such, indicators and findings, for all three dimensions, are not directly comparable. 

Labor: The baseline survey administered the labor module on 2-3 randomly selected adults in the household. For the tracking survey, any one of the 2-3 adults who had completed the baseline survey were interviewed in a given tracking round. Weights were re-adjusted in each of the tracking rounds to ensure comparability with baseline population characteristics.

Access to basic needs: The basic needs modules across the rounds have collected information on a variety of topics ranging from a household's ability to have purchased basic food items, difficulties faced in obtaining said items, access to health services, consumption patterns and credit seeking behavior. All data collected is at household level.

Education: The education module was introduced in R2 and has collected information on educational engagement of school-aged children (all 3-18 years old at baseline 2019) amidst COVID-19. Note that the modules ask about any engagement in educational activities and not about school enrolment in context of COVID-19 school closures, thus comparisons with baseline figures should be approached carefully.

Note that Round 1 collected information on labor and access to basic needs only; the module on education was added Round 2 onwards. 

Please refer to the published briefs for details on how the indicators and findings should be inferred. Briefs are available here: https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bangladesh/brief/cox-s-bazar-panel-survey-briefs",NA,"The CBPS study has a total sample size of 5,020 households (HHs), divided among three strata covering Rohingya refugees in camps and host communities in Cox’s Bazar district and some adjacent regions of Bandarban district. The CBPS HFT attempted to follow the full baseline sample of 5,020 household in each round, with no alterations or additions made to the sampling design. The baseline sampling strategy is detailed below. 
The three strata are defined as:  
i. Rohingya refugees in camps 
ii. High exposure hosts: hosts within 15 km (3-hour walking distance) of camps
iii. Low exposure hosts: hosts at more than 15 km (3-hour walking distance) from camps
(In the datasets, the 'settlement_type' and 'stratum' variables identify the different levels at which the sample is representative)

Defining the camp strata: A two-step data collection on Rohingya refugee prevalence within host communities (i.e., outside of camps) confirmed that prevalence in host communities was low, and that this was the case not only for newer Rohingya displaced, but for the older cohort of displaced, as well. This pattern of refugee prevalence supported having one stratum for the Rohingya displaced living in camps. The sampling strategy for the CBPS therefore focused on generating representative estimates for the camp based Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar district.

Defining the host strata: For hosts, the sampling strategy was designed to account for the differential implications of a camp-based concentration of close to a million Rohingya displaced for different areas of Cox’s Bazar. To distinguish between host communities that are differentially affected by the arrival of the Rohingya, the CBPS sampling strategy used a threshold of three hours’ walking time from a campsite to define two survey strata: (i) host communities with potentially high exposure (HE) to the displaced Rohingya, and (ii) host communities with potentially low exposure (LE).

Sampling frame: The camp sample uses the Needs and Population Monitoring Round 12 (NPM12) data from the International Organization for Migration as the sampling frame. For the host sample, a combination of the 2011 population census, Admin 4 shapefiles from the Bureau of Statistics and publicly available Google Earth imagery and OpenStreetMaps were used to develop a sampling frame.

Stages of sample selection: For camps, NPM12 divided all camps into 1,954 majhee blocks.1 200 blocks were randomly selected using a probability proportional to the size of the camp. A full listing was carried out in each selected camp block.

For hosts, a two-stage sampling strategy was followed. The first stage of selection was done at the mauza level by strata. A random sample of 66 mauzas was drawn from a frame of 286 mauzas using probability proportional to size. Based on census population size, each mauza was divided into segments of roughly 100-150 households. The second stage selected three segments from each selected mauza with equal probability of selection.

Listing and replacements: Within each selected PSU in camps (blocks) and hosts (mauza-segments), all households (100-150 on average) were listed. Of listed households, 13 households were selected at random for interview, with an additional replacement list of 5 households. 
More information on the sampling strategy and process can be found on the published working paper titled “Data Triangulation Strategies to Design a Representative Household Survey of Hosts and Rohingya Displaced in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh”.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The R1 tracking questionnaire was developed as a lean version of the questionnaire implemented during the CBPS baseline. The R2 and R3 questionnaires retained certain aspects of the R1 questionnaire, but also added more detailed questions on aspects such as food security (in consultation with UN-WFP) and credit-seeking and coping behavior based on findings observed in previous rounds and dynamic research needs within the COVID-19 crisis.

One questionnaire was developed per round of data collection with modules containing household level questions on access to basic needs, credit-seeking behavior, access to health services, vaccinations and individual level questions on labor market status. Any adult, knowledgeable member of the confirmed sample household were eligible to answer the household modules. The labor module was only permitted if the respondent reached was any one of the 2-3 selected adults within the household who had completed the baseline adult questionnaires.

Questionnaires were developed in English and translated into Bengali. The translations to Bengali were thoroughly reviewed by the World Bank team’s local consultants to ensure quality. Pretesting and piloting were done using the Bengali questionnaires.

All questionnaires and modules in English are provided as external resources.","There are three types of weights in the CBPS baseline datasets. In what follows, the “level” of a dataset refers to what each observation in the data set represents i.e. a household, an individual, an occupation of an individual, etc. In general, the appropriate weight to be used is based on the unit of sampling: i.e. HH weights should be used for data collected at the level of the household (i.e. the household survey); and AA weights should be used for data collected at the level of individual adults i.e. the adult survey).

The two types of baseline weights – household weight and adult weight – have been readjusted for each tracking round based on the response rate. The respective tracking round weights are available on each dataset. Labor datasets contain aa_weight_r# and the basic needs datasets contain hh_weight_r#. The education datasets do not contain weights variable as individual roster member weights were not created during the baseline. It is expected that education outcomes will be analyzed at the household level using the hh_weight_r# weights.","Krishnan, Nandini; Khan, Afsana; Haque, Arshia; Tillan, Pablo; Endara, Joaquin, 2020, Cox's Bazar Panel Survey High Frequency Phone Tracking Surveys Rounds 1,2,3 (CBPS HFT'20-21), [URL], World Bank, V1","The user of the data acknowledges that the original collector of the data, the authorized distributor of the data, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.",0,0,90.24842878246852,23.844949865639045,South Asia,Bangladesh,Lower middle income,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,South Asia,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At the same time, this assessment has identified continuing service gaps in the Rohingya response.  For example, the majority of households do not believe there is enough light at night to safely access latrines, and WASH facilities are generally perceived as dangerous areas for girls under age 18. In terms of access to protection services, only a small number of households report members making use of children and women friendly spaces. Despite widespread distribution coverage of key non-food items such as kitchen sets, demand for these items remains high, and refugees are spending the greatest portion of their limited financial resources on basic items including food, clothing and fuel. Findings suggest that there are uncertainties around actions to prepare for cyclones.

Out of a total of 1,455 surveys conducted, 1,277 were deemed sufficient for further analysis. The sample of 1,277 respondents can be considered broadly representative of the total adult, new Rohingya population residing in the selected refugee camps across Cox’s Bazar district

The enumerators were given instructions to select respondents randomly in the chosen camps which was not always possible for several reasons. Hence, even though the sample can be considered representative of the population under study, the potential for selection bias cannot be excluded.

The enumerators, as Rohingya refugees themselves and fluent in Rohingya, could clarify questions posed by the respondents. However, the questions and the responses were translated from English to Rohingya and from Rohingya to English respectively by each enumerator on the spot. This might have resulted in misinterpretations and/or negatively influenced the accuracy of some responses.

Data regarding the respondents’ views of Rohingya involvement in illegal activities, substance use as a coping mechanism, and of violence in the camps should be interpreted with caution because of the potential for bias due to respondents trying to preserve the image of their community with regards to these sensitive topics",Face-to-face,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,90.24842878246852,23.844949865639045,South Asia,Bangladesh,Lower middle income,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,South Asia,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The aim was to increase the understanding of humanitarian actors of the living conditions, primary needs, vulnerabilities and coping strategies of the asylum seekers and migrants. 
This study aims to provide a representative overview of the profiles of Venezuelan asylum seekers and migrants living in different geographic locations and shelter settings in Brazil, for the purpose of increasing the understanding of humanitarian actors as to the extent to which the living conditions, needs, and vulnerabilities of Venezuelan households vary between households living in abrigos and those living in host communities, across three cities that are relevant nodes in the Brazilian refugee response: Pacaraima, Boa Vista, and Manaus.  The findings indicate that challenges related to accessing services are relatively similar across different locations and shelter settings. The findings indicate that challenges related to accessing services are relatively similar across different locations and shelter settings. Of all services, Venezuelans seem to face the most challenges regarding access to education; findings suggest that a lack of required documents and a limited local capacity are constraining the enrolment of Venezuelan children into local schools.

The latest is the Central African armed disturbance unleashed in March 2013. This conflict has caused a massive influx of people to the countries bordering the Central African Republic. In Congo, the majority of refugees have been received in the department of Likouala. This influx was added to the DRC and Rwandan refugees already present in the area.

Since the beginning of the operation, the humanitarian organizations, AARREC, Solidarité Internationale and the Congolese Red Cross have implemented the actions Water Hygiene and Sanitation in the hosting camps and villages through the financing of UNHCR. Various structures (latrines, wells and boreholes, washing area, etc.) have been installed for the benefit of the beneficiaries. 
The aim of these actions is to ensure for all sites: (i) access to sufficient and good quality drinking water, (ii) sustainable access to sanitation facilities, and (iii) improve knowledge and practices in personal and collective hygiene. To better understand and measure the current state of knowledge and practices of the populations living in the various refugee sites, a KAP survey focusing on water, hygiene and sanitation issues was conducted from December 13 to 27, 2017.

These sites were in turn subdivided into clusters in a way that each household on the site has the same chance of being selected. This result is obtained using the probability proportional to size method.
For the second step, the households in each cluster to be surveyed were selected by the team leaders using a systematic draw according to the size of each zone.

The results contribute to an evidence base for reporting against UNHCR’s multi-year strategies to key stakeholders.

The RMS can be implemented in any operational context. A standard structured questionnaire has been developed for the RMS, which can be conducted as a stand-alone survey or flexibly integrated with other data collection exercises. The data includes indicators collected at both the household and individual (household-member) level, and results are statistically representative.

This RMS took place in the Republic of the Congo between January and February 2023. The population of interest included refugees and asylum-seekers.

Most governments in the region have made efforts to facilitate access to territory, documentation and access to services, but the capacity of host countries has become overstretched to address the increasing protection and integration needs, resulting in tighter border controls being put in place.

Phase 2 was conducted in partnership with the UNDP LAC Chief Economist Office and included two waves.

Ecuador has been part of all waves of data collection as part of the Regional effort. In 2022, in partnership with the Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement, two additional waves of data were collected in February and June. During all four waves of the HFPS Phase 2 in Ecuador, Venezuelan households were also included using a different sampling methodology but using the same instruments for comparison to local counterparts.

This allows users to compare certain indicators of living conditions of households and individuals with the 2020 HFPS. Additionally, this phase gathered information on access and use of internet and digital banking services, gender issues, mental health, coping mechanisms and childcare. For Ecuador, two additional waves were conducted, in February and June 2022.

The surveys are representative Venezuelan adult migrants, their households, and for Waves 2, 3 and 4, children 0-4 years of age and children 5-17 in those households. 

Eligible respondents for the HFPS were adults 18 years old and above. Only one respondent per household was interviewed, and he/she answered individual, child and household-level questions. To ensure the inclusion of Venezuelan individuals, a different sample frame was used and potential respondents received a first call to confirm if they were indeed Venezuelan and if they were willing to participate in the survey.",NA,"Considering Venezuelans are a small part of the population in Ecuador, the strategy to identify and sample Venezuelan migrants is different from that used for the overall population.
To create a sampling frame, a list of all cell phone numbers of customers who registered regular incoming or outgoing calls from Venezuela was generated. A first-phase simple random sample was selected from this frame and called to confirm if the owners were indeed Venezuelan and determine if they were willing to participate in the survey.
From those that agreed to participate in the study and were confirmed as Venezuelan adults, a second-phase sample was selected to complete the survey. See Sampling Design and Weighting document for more detail.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],Available in Spanish. Questionnaires have some variations among waves.,"HFPS Phase 2 has three units of analysis: households, adult individuals (18 years of age and older) and children 6 through 17 years of age. Weights were computed for each sample unit and should be used according to the estimate of interest.

The weighting process for the Venezuelan sample of the Ecuador HFPS involves five steps:
1. Calculation of the inclusion probabilities of cell phone numbers.
2. Computation of design weights for households and individuals.
3. Nonresponse weighting adjustment.
4. Calibration of household, adult and child/adolescent weights, using data from the 2019 Survey “Encuesta a Personas en Movilidad Humana y Comunidades Receptoras (EPEC).
5. Weight trimming and recalibration.

For wave 2, an additional weight adjustment was introduced for the panel cases to account for the attrition nonresponse between wave 1 and wave 2. For waves 3 and 4, all the ever-selected phone numbers were called, not only those that had responded in the previous waves. Therefore, no attrition adjustments were needed, and the weighting procedures were equivalent to those applied in Wave 1.

To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), though we do not have information for all of the steps:

Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on characteristics of the household head (i.e. education, labor force status, demographic characteristics), characteristics of the household (consumption, assets, financial characteristics), and characteristics of the dwelling (house ownership, overcrowding). While the proGRES database is limited in the number of socio-economic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the proGRES database.
Additional technical details and explanations on each of the steps briefly outlined above can be found in Himelein, K. (2014).","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include: - the Identification of the Primary Investigator - the title of the survey (including country, acronym, and year of implementation) - the survey reference number - the source and date of download

The SF-based survey was conducted in half of the IDP sample clusters (12 clusters). The SF-based survey was conducted by randomly selecting 30 households from each randomly selected cluster for the interview. Random selection of 30 IDP households was done once the IDP household listing was conducted by GPS in the selected clusters. The listing exercise involved GPS visiting the 13 selected clusters and working with local focal points to acquire and review the list of all IDP households at the cluster level. 30 households per cluster were selected for the interview. If any cluster was too large and the IDP households were too scattered, households were randomly selected from the smaller cluster.

The RDS-based approach was used in half of the IDP clusters. RDS is typically applied in contexts where a sampling frame is not available or is unreliable and when it is not possible to randomly select a sample representing the entire population of interest. This method combines 'snowball sampling' (getting individuals to refer those they know, who in turn refer those they know, and so on) with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for the fact that the sample was collected in a non-random way.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],NA,NA,"UNHCR (2022).

The sample consisted of four strata based on four regions: Tigray Afar (Eritrean refugees), Gambella (South Sudanese refugees), Benishangul Gumuz (Sudanese refugees), and Somali (Somali refugees). Each region hosts predominantly one refugee nationality leading to an implicit stratification based on nationality. In each stratum, camps were divided into Enumeration Areas (EAs) of equal size using GIS technology, and 82 EAs were selected per stratum.

For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households, and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA (usually 12) divided by the total number of households listed in the EA.

Given the disruption of the functioning of some democratic institutions and rule of law, and its impact on the preservation of security, economic stability, health, public peace and the general welfare system, the crisis continues to worsen and serious human rights violations are widely reported. The displacement outside Venezuela has mostly affected countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and the southern Caribbean islands.

The study aims to shed light on how evolving conditions of prolonged displacement change the lives of IDPs over time and how IDPs themselves adapt and engineer solutions to displacement-related challenges.

The study is based on the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s (IASC-2010) Framework on Durable Solutions, which lays the cornerstone for specifying how governments, humanitarian practitioners and academics alike attempt to measure IDPs’ advancement toward durable solutions. The framework defines three 'durable solutions' — sustainable return, sustainable reintegration or sustainable resettlement — each of which depends on the fulfillment of eight criteria: long-term safety and security; adequate standard of living; access to livelihood and employment; access to effective and accessible mechanisms to restore housing, land and property; access to personal and other documentation; family reunification; participation in public affairs and access to effective remedies and justice. IDPs are said to have reached a durable solution when they 'no longer have any specific assistance and protection needs that are linked to their displacement and can enjoy their human rights without discrimination on account of their displacement.

The surveys allowed an analysis of a range of socio-economic indicators and the estimation of poverty trends. To provide more frequent poverty estimates, Continuous Household Survey (CHS) was implemented in 2014 on a sub-sample of IHSES clusters. However, the fieldwork was disrupted in the summer of 2014 in some parts of the country due to the deterioration in the security situation. The third round of IHSES, planned for 2017, could not take place on time as well. At the same time, the ongoing security and budget crises made it more important than ever to monitor key socio-economic indicators.

Given the large number of people displaced within the country since 2014, the survey was designed to capture a representative sample of internally displaced persons. Furthermore, given the prevalence of Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan region, the survey also sampled refugee households in Kurdistan. A socioeconomic survey of camp residents was conducted by CSO and KRSO in 2017 so to avoid duplication of effort, the camp residents were excluded from the SWIFT survey. Informal ad-hoc settlements that have been constructed since the last update of sampling frame were included in the survey through household listing operation in the sampled enumeration areas. The survey was designed to cover all governorates, including areas in Nineveh deemed safe for field visits.

The sampling design followed a nested logic. All households in the sample responded to a short questionnaire. The short form collected information on the following core non-monetary indicators of well-being: household roster, education attainment, labor market variables, dwelling characteristics, access to basic services, asset ownership, transfers and assistance (public and private), incidence of shocks, and subjective well-being. A random subset of the sampled households also responded to the complete list of questions on household expenditure. The full sample was designed to be representative for each governorate. The expenditure sub-sample was representation at the regional level, where each region comprises three to five governorates.

Within each governorate, the out-of-camp sample was selected in two stages as following.  First, using the exhaustive list of Census Enumeration Areas as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), between 60 to 150 EAs in each governorate was selected using Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) criteria, with the number of households in each area as the measure of size.  Listing exercise was conducted in the selected areas to update the list of households. In the second stage, using households as secondary sampling units (SSUs), six households were selected in each cluster with equal probability from the post-listing sampling frame. The sample of households in the second stage was stratified by residence status. In selecting six households from a cluster, three each of IDP and non-IDP households were selected in the non-Kurdistan region. In the Kurdistan region, two each of IDP, non-IDP, and refugee households were selected. If an enumeration area in Kurdistan had fewer than two refugee or IDP households, the gap was filled by randomly selecting resident households from the same enumeration area. Likewise, if a PSU in the rest of Iraq had fewer than three IDP households, the shortfall was met by resident households to reach a total of 6 households per PSU.

Expenditure information was collected from a subsample of households from a subsample of enumeration areas. In Kurdistan, one household each of residents, IDPs, and refugees in a subset of clusters responded to the expenditure questions and in Rest of Iraq, one household each of residents and IDPs answered the expenditure questions.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],NA,NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The first difficulty was that, as of 2015, there was no recent or reliable sample frame, even for Lebanese households, as the last official population census was conducted in 1932. Typically, such a sample frame consists of the universe of enumeration areas in a country, with associated estimates of population. This meant that we had to construct our own sample frame by selecting a few Small Area Units (SAUs) and then conducting a full listing operation by visiting every household within the selected SAUs and collecting basic demographic and contact information. The second difficulty was that there was no available cartographic division of the country into geographic areas small enough to be the subject of a full listing operation, which could then serve as a sampling frame for the SAUs. Circonscription Foncières (CF) were the finest level of disaggregation available; CFs are generally too large to be listed as some have populations of over 100,000. Finally, there was no available sampling frame for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which meant that we had to depend on UNHCR data on registered Syrian refugees, combined with the estimates of Lebanese population at the CF level. Given these challenges and time and budgetary constraints, the sample was selected in multiple (four) stages.

2.Increase the understanding of the situation of Syrian refugees with disabilities and their households compared to their peers without disabilities in relation to access to services, including education.

3.Recommend inclusive actions to be prioritized by humanitarian actors.

Quantitative data was collected in Lebanon in December 2017 and in Jordan in between October 2017 and January 2018. In Lebanon, 2,495 refugees from 506 households were randomly sampled in urban settings in Bar Elias as well as Informal Tented Settlements (ITS) in Bar Elias and Arsal. In Jordan, 6,381 refugees were randomly sampled in 1,159 households in Azraq and Zaatari camps and Irbid. In light of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD), the study defined disability as interactions between personal and environmental factors.

The 2012 JPFHS sample was designed to produce reliable estimates of major survey variables for the country as a whole, urban and rural areas, each of the 12 governorates, and for the two special domains: the Badia areas and people living in refugee camps. To facilitate comparisons with previous surveys, the sample was also designed to produce estimates for the three regions (North, Central, and South). The grouping of the governorates into regions is as follows: the North consists of Irbid, Jarash, Ajloun, and Mafraq governorates; the Central region consists of Amman, Madaba, Balqa, and Zarqa governorates; and the South region consists of Karak, Tafiela, Ma'an, and Aqaba governorates.

The 2012 JPFHS sample was selected from the 2004 Jordan Population and Housing Census sampling frame. The frame excludes the population living in remote areas (most of whom are nomads), as well as those living in collective housing units such as hotels, hospitals, work camps, prisons, and the like. For the 2004 census, the country was subdivided into convenient area units called census blocks. For the purposes of the household surveys, the census blocks were regrouped to form a general statistical unit of moderate size (30 households or more), called a ""cluster"", which is widely used in surveys as a primary sampling unit (PSU).

Stratification was achieved by first separating each governorate into urban and rural areas and then, within each urban and rural area, by Badia areas, refugee camps, and other. A two-stage sampling procedure was employed. In the first stage, 806 clusters were selected with probability proportional to the cluster size, that is, the number of residential households counted in the 2004 census. A household listing operation was then carried out in all of the selected clusters, and the resulting lists of households served as the sampling frame for the selection of households in the second stage. In the second stage of selection, a fixed number of 20 households was selected in each cluster with an equal probability systematic selection. A subsample of two-thirds of the selected households was identified for anthropometry measurements.

Refer to Appendix A in the final report (Jordan Population and Family Health Survey 2012) for details of sampling weights calculation.",Face-to-face,"The 2012 JPFHS used two questionnaires, namely the Household Questionnaire and the Woman’s Questionnaire (see Appendix D). The Household Questionnaire was used to list all usual members of the sampled households, and visitors who slept in the household the night before the interview, and to obtain information on each household member’s age, sex, educational attainment, relationship to the head of the household, and marital status. In addition, questions were included on the socioeconomic characteristics of the household, such as source of water, sanitation facilities, and the availability of durable goods. Moreover, the questionnaire included questions about child discipline. The Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women who were eligible for the individual interview (ever-married women age 15-49 years). In addition, all women age 15-49 and children under age 5 living in the subsample of households were eligible for height and weight measurement and anemia testing.

The Woman’s Questionnaire was administered to ever-married women age 15-49 and collected information on the following topics:
• Respondent’s background characteristics
• Birth history
• Knowledge, attitudes, and practice of family planning and exposure to family planning messages
• Maternal health (antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care)
• Immunization and health of children under age 5
• Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices
• Marriage and husband’s background characteristics
• Fertility preferences
• Respondent’s employment
• Knowledge of AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
• Other health issues specific to women
• Early childhood development
• Domestic violence

In addition, information on births, pregnancies, and contraceptive use and discontinuation during the five years prior to the survey was collected using a monthly calendar.

The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS program. Additions and modifications to the model questionnaires were made in order to provide detailed information specific to Jordan. The questionnaires were then translated into Arabic.

Anthropometric data were collected during the 2012 JPFHS in a subsample of two-thirds of the selected households in each cluster. All women age 15-49 and children age 0-4 in these households were measured for height using Shorr height boards and for weight using electronic Seca scales. In addition, a drop of capillary blood was taken from these women and children in the field to measure their hemoglobin level using the HemoCue system.

What was particularly attractive about the latest census from the perspective of sampling was that it explicitly asked about the nationality of all residents. This would have allowed stratification of areas by density of Syrians. However, the original design could not be implemented because we could not access the new sample frame based on the 2015 Jordanian census. The design was then amended to include a representative sample of the Azraq and Za'atari camps (which account for the vast majority of Syrian refugees in camps in Jordan). This sample was complemented by purposive samples of the surrounding governorates, Mafraq and Zarqa, where the sample included areas physically proximate to the camp and other areas with a high number of Syrian refugees. In Amman Governorate, a purposive sample was drawn, combining a geographically distributed sample with a sample of areas with a high prevalence of Syrian refugees per the 2015 census, as indicated by the Jordanian Department of Statistics. Analytically, this implies the insights from Jordan will be limited to camp residents, neighboring areas of the camps, and Amman governorate. For this reason, Amman is left out of the rest of the discussion, where our focus is on relating the innovative approaches that we followed to obtain near-representative sample in absence of recent sampling frame.

Two principle methods were used to collect primary data: household questionnaire and documents review in a summative evaluation approach. 

The survey adopted a summative evaluation approach and a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods were used to obtain answers to the survey questions. The mixed approach was adopted for purposes of complementary, triangulation, and validation of responses. Primary data was collected with the use of household questionnaires, Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and review of existing literatures and reports. The inclusive criteria of the survey allowed the enumerators to collect data from household heads or any household member of age 18 years and above who consented to participate in the survey. Qualitative methods mainly KIIs were also adopted in order to gather an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of the various primary targets of the programme. These included households, members of WASH Committees, NRC staff and staff from the implementing partner agencies. Observation method was also used during the survey to assess WASH infrastructure and human habits. The infrastructure included; water points, sanitation and hygiene facilities.

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites, and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey was designed to address these shortcomings and support the settlement's development framework, as well as the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless. Waves 1-7 of this survey include information on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, transfers, health, and COVID-19 knowledge. Wave 8 focused on how households were exposed to shocks, in particular adverse weather shocks and the increase in the price of food and fuel, but also included parts of the previous modules on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, and subjective wellbeing.

It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless, where sampling approaches differ across strata. For refugees in Kakuma and Kalobeyei, as well as for stateless people, recently conducted Socioeconomic Surveys (SES), were used as sampling frames. For the refugee population living in urban areas and the Dadaab camp, no such household survey data existed, and sampling frames were based on UNHCR's registration records (proGres), which include phone numbers. For Kakuma, Kalobeyei, Dadaab and urban refugees, a two-step sampling process was used. First, 1,000 individuals from each stratum were selected from the corresponding sampling frames. Each of these individuals received a text message to confirm that the registered phone was still active. In the second stage, implicitly stratifying by sex and age, the verified phone number lists were used to select the sample. Until wave 7 sampled households that were not reached in earlier waves were also contacted along with households that were interviewed before.  In wave 8 only households that had previously participated in the survey were contacted for interview. The “wave” variable represents in which wave the households were interviewed in.  For the stateless population, all the participants of the Shona socioeconomic survey (n=400) were included in the RRPS, because of limited sample size. The sampling frames for the refugee and Shona stateless communities are thus representative of households with active phone numbers registered with UNHCR.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],"The questionnaire included 12  sections

Section 12: Conclusion","Sampling weights for the refugee and stateless samples were tailored to the respective sampling strategies. Kakuma and Kalobeyei sub-samples have used the baseline weights from the respective SES underlying the sampling frame to adjust for any differences in the sampling probabilities. Then, propensity score weighting based on the full population covered in the SES household survey, have been used to account for differences in the probability of owning a phone number. The estimated propensity score reflects the household probability to have a phone number registered by UNHCR. To mitigate the effect of outlier estimates, the mean propensity score is computed for each decile. The baseline weights are then multiplied with the inverse of the propensity score deciles. For the refugees living in Dadaab camp and urban areas, a cell weighting approach has been used. Thereby, the sample is split into sub-groups (cells) based on the gender and age group of household head. The weights were then scaled such that they reflect the proportion of each cell in the UNHCR registration data of all refugees living in the respective location. In the group of stateless people registered with UNHCR, each household has the same weight assigned, as their full population is called in this survey. Lastly, to ensure sampling weights have the correct proportions across strata, they have been scaled to match population totals as provided by the up to date UNHCR registration data. Variable: weight
The data is also weekly representative for all waves except for wave 8. The variable weight_weekly should be used for weekly representative estimates.
Panel Weights 
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals: 
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1 
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples 
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups 
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile 
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac 
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2) 
6. Apply post-stratification in the same way as for cross-sectional weights (step 2) Variable: weight_panel_w1_2

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites (about 40% of the total refugees in Kenya), and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey replicates the preceding Kalobeyei SES (2018), designed to address these shortcomings and support the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals. Data was collected in October 2019 to December 2019, covering about 2,122 households.",2019-10-21-2019-12-1,Household and individual,"Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya",Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey included a range of socio-economic indicators, both at the household and individual household member levels, aligned with the national 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) and the 2019 Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS). 

The SES is designed to be representative of all households living in Kakuma, which are defined as groups of people who regularly cook and share meals together. The Kakuma SES covers 2,122 households across the four Kakuma subcamps.

The scope of the questionnaire includes:
- Education

Most refugees in Kenya live in camps located in the impoverished counties of Turkana (40 percent) and Garissa (44 percent), while 16 percent inhabit urban areas—mainly in Nairobi but also in Mombasa and Nakuru.
Refugees in Kenya are not systematically included in national surveys, creating a lack of comparable socioeconomic data on camp-based and urban refugees, and their hosts. As the third of a series of surveys focusing on closing this gap, this Socioeconomic Survey of Urban Refugees's aim is to understand the socioeconomic needs of urban refugees in Kenya, especially in the face of ongoing conflicts, environmental
hazards, and others shocks, as well as the recent government announcement to close Kenya’s refugee camps, which highlights the potential move of refugees from camps into urban settings
The SESs are representative of urban refugees and camp-based refugees in Turkana County. For the Kalobeyei 2018 and Urban 2020–21 SESs, households were randomly selected from the UNHCR registration database (proGres), while a complete list of dwellings,
obtained from UNHCR’s dwelling mapping exercise, was used to draw the sample for the Kakuma 2019 SES. The Kalobeyei SES and Kakuma SES were done via Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). Due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, the Urban SES
was collected via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). The Kalobeyei SES covers 6,004 households; the Kakuma SES covers 2,127 households; and the Urban SES covers 2,438 households in Nairobi, Nakuru, and Mombasa. 
Questionnaires are aligned with national household survey instruments, while additional modules are added to explore refugee-specific dynamics.

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the survey data was collected via telephone. Hence, the survey is representative of households with active phone numbers registered by UNHCR in urban Kenya – Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru.  A sample size of 2,500 was needed to ensure a margin of error of less than 5 percent at a confidence level of 95 percent for groups represented by at least 50 percent of the population. 
  The sample for the urban SES is designed to estimate socioeconomic indicators, such as food insecurity, for groups whose share represents at least 50 percent of the population. Considering the total urban refugee population as of August 2020 and the proportions of main countries of origin, as well as a 10 percent nonresponse rate, the target sample size is 2,500 households in total, with 1,250 in Nairobi, 700 in Nakuru, and 550 in Mombasa. A total of 2,438 households were reached: 1,300 in Nairobi, 409 in Nakuru, and 729 in Mombasa. 
  The units in ProGres list are UNHCR proGres families, which are different from households as defined in standard household surveys. Upon registration, UNHCR groups individuals into ‘proGres’ families which do not necessarily meet the criteria to be considered a household. A proGres family is usually comprised by no more than one household. In turn, a household can be integrated by one or more proGres families.
Households were selected as the unit of observation to ensure comparability with national household surveys. Households are a set of related or unrelated people (either sharing the same dwelling or not) who pool ration cards and regularly cook and eat together. As proGres families were sampled, the identification of households was done by an introductory section that confirms that each member of the selected proGres family is a member of the household and whether there are other members in the households that belong to other ProGres families. Thus, the introductory section documents the number of proGres families present in the household under observation.
Before selecting the survey strata, the team attempted to better understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phones. From the proGres data, phone penetration in urban areas is high (Nairobi and Mombasa: 93 percent, Nakuru: 95 percent). To understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phone, we looked at socio-economic outcomes for proGres family refugees with access to a phone number and those without",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],NA,"The sampling weights were constructed using the outline in Himelein (2014): i) as the first step, the base weight was computed, equal to 1 for all households.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted in the 4 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo, Ifo 2 and Hagadera) between 28 August and 23 September 2017 by nutrition partners (MSF-Switzerland, Islamic Relief Kenya, International Rescue Committee and Kenya Red Cross) with overall coordination by UNHCR supported by WFP.
 
After the increase in the prevalence of GAM observed in 2016 (10.2% weighted prevalence of GAM in all camps from 8.1% in 2015), the 2017 SENS indicated weigthed prevalence of GAM 9.7% which is close to what it was in 2016. The difference between the weighted prevalence of GAM in all the camps in 2016 and 2017 is not statistically significant. However, its to be mentioned that the prevalence of GAM in Dagahaley, Hagdera, and Ifo 2 camp is 8.3%, 8.6%, and 9.4% which is classified as POOR nutrition sitation, while in Ifo camp its 12.7% classified as SERIOUS nutrition sitaition as per the WHO classiciation of the public health significance. Overall, weighted anaemia prevalence showed a sharp increase among children aged 6-59 months to 60.7%, up from 49.7% in 2016. This is well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold) and requires attention. In all camps, anaemia was well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold). The children 6-23 age group had the highest prevalence of anaemia; however, the prevalence in the children 24-35 age group was also very concerning as it was above the critical threshold in all camps.",2017-08-28-2017-09-2,"Children 0-23 months

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The 2-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters from each of the 3 camps. At the first stage, a list of blocks was made before the required number were selected using sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) using ENA softwareIn nearly all cases, a cluster was the equivalent of a block. However, there were exceptions where, for some larger blocks, more than 1 cluster was selected. In this case, the blocks were split further to cater for more than one cluster. In the event that a selected block had more than 250 households, according to SMART guidance, segmentation was done, after which one of the segments was randomly selected to be the cluster.

All households in the selected clusters were labelled before data collection. At the second stage, the required number of households were selected using systematic random sampling from a list of households. A random number was selected between 1 and the sampling interval, which was calculated by dividing the total number of households in the cluster with the required number of households. The selected number became the first household to be surveyed. Subsequent households were selected by adding the sampling interval until the required number of households were completed. All eligible children below 5 years of age from all selected households were surveyed for the Child Anthropometry and Health, and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), and WASH. Half of the selected households were selected for the Food Security and Women questionnaire. The survey respondents were the primary caretakers of children below 5 years.

- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The 2-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters from each of the 3 camps. At the first stage, a list of blocks was made before the required number were selected using sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) using ENA softwareIn nearly all cases, a cluster was the equivalent of a block. However, there were exceptions where, for some larger blocks, more than 1 cluster was selected. In this case, the blocks were split further to cater for more than one cluster. In the event that a selected block had more than 250 households, according to SMART guidance, segmentation was done, after which one of the segments was randomly selected to be the cluster.

All households in the selected clusters were labelled before data collection. At the second stage, the required number of households were selected using systematic random sampling from a list of households. A random number was selected between 1 and the sampling interval, which was calculated by dividing the total number of households in the cluster with the required number of households. The selected number became the first household to be surveyed. Subsequent households were selected by adding the sampling interval until the required number of households were completed. All eligible children below 5 years of age from all selected households were surveyed for the Child Anthropometry and Health, and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), and WASH. Half of the selected households were selected for the Food Security and Women questionnaire. The survey respondents were the primary caretakers of children below 5 years. Abandoned households were not included in the sampling frame. Absent households or households where children were absent were re-visited before the end of the day. If they were found to be empty, they were recorded as missing and were not replaced.

The 2017 annual Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) at the Kakuma Refugee Camps was conducted from 22nd November to 3rd December 2017. It was coordinated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) with support from World Food Programme (WFP), International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Kenya Red Cross (KRC). The survey used SMART methodology and UNHCR SENS guidelines version 2 (2013) for implementation. While previous surveys indicated a steady decline in GAM prevalence between April 2010 and November 2014. 

There was a considerable increase in GAM prevalence in Kakuma from November 2015 and 2016. Though the difference was not statistically significant. However, in 2017 there has been a significant reduction in GAM prevalence in both Kakuma and Kalobeyei. There has also been a significant change in stunting for Kalobeyei, the same reduction was observed for Kakuma where stunting prevalence has reduced to below the 40% threshold of public health significance. Anaemia in children 6-59 months remains above the 40% threshold of public health significance for both survey areas but anaemia in women, 15-59 years was below 40%. A slight increase was observed in Kakuma while a reduction was observed in Kalobeyei. The November 2017 survey also shows an improvement in Vitamin A supplementation coverage, and water availability.

In November 2017, the World Food Programme (WFP) joined the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in the delivery of multi-purpose cash (MPC) to assist the most economically vulnerable Syrian refugee households to meet their basic needs. 

This study aims to measure the short-term (12 months or less) and long-term (more than 12 months) causal impact of the $173.50 and $175 MPC assistance provided by WFP and UNHCR respectively, over and above the $27 per person per month assistance, as well as the impact of discontinuation from MPC on the well-being of Syrian refugees. This report presents the causal impact on multiple dimensions of well-being, namely household expenditures, food security, housing, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education, employment, health and decision-making. 

The key take-away messages from the study are: 
1. The impact of MPC materialised across most dimensions of well-being in the long-term, indicating the importance of households' access to a longer duration of MPC.
2. The benefits of MPC fade for many indicators within 4 to 10 months after discontinuation, and households' well-being returned to pre-assistance levels for most indicators, and dropped slightly below the pre-assistance baseline for others. 
3. The findings would suggest that there are benefits to instituting longer cash cycles and/or linking MPC to other services through a 'cash plus' approach to expand and extend the positive impact of cash on beneficiary households and ensure sustainable impact. 

A total of 11,457 households were visited and used in this analysis, which constitutes one of the largest samples among impact evaluations conducted in Lebanon to date.",2018-07-23-2019-09-0,Household and individual.,"Bekaa, North, and Mount Lebanon",Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

The impact evaluation used a quasi-experimental fuzzy regression discontinuity design, which enables estimation of the causal impact of MPC after different enrolment periods in the programme (rather than producing simple correlations). For this purpose, a multi-sectoral household survey was collected across three regions in Lebanon (Bekaa, North, and Mount Lebanon), where 85 per cent of Syrian refugees and 94 per cent of MPC beneficiaries live, over three waves of data collection held in July/ August 2018, February/March 2019, and July/August 2019. The multiple rounds of data collection allowed for the measurement of effects that materialise at different points in time and enabled the validation of the detected impact. Furthermore, collecting data in the summer and winter made it possible to account for seasonal variations, and accessing administrative data from UNHCR on other assistance programmes targeting the population of interest made it possible to append this information and distinguish between the effect of MPC and other programmes. WFP and UNHCR cash assistance beneficiaries are selected based on a proxy means testing formula that constructs a vulnerability score for each household based on a set of socio-demographic characteristics from the UNHCR database. This score predicts the per capita expenditure level of households and is used to rank them from most to least vulnerable. All households with a score below the SMEB are eligible for MPC. However, due to budgetary constraints, only about 29 per cent of eligible households currently receive the MPC package. WFP follows a bottom-up approach by including in the programme households starting from the lowest scores and moving up the scores until the allocated funding is fully disbursed. UNHCR employs a geographical bottomup targeting approach by including the most vulnerable households in each geographic region until it reaches the regions allocated proportion given its budget constraints. Accordingly, the point at which the funding is fully disbursed creates an artificial cut-off line. This creates a quasi-natural experiment where households on either side of the cut-off are plausibly similar along observable and unobservable characteristics. As a result, the argument is that the only difference is the receipt of MPC. Thus, any differences in outcomes between households are attributable to the amount of cash assistance received, which allows for measuring the causal impact of the MPC. Notably, because the annual recalibration of the targeting formula that determines a households eligibility for MPC occurred prior to the collection of wave 2 data, this uniquely positioned the study to measure the impact of discontinuation on affected household.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaire included the following sections: demographics, education, employment, health, food, housing, economic situation, accountability.",NA,"Please cite as follows:

The first difficulty was that, as of 2015, there was no recent or reliable sample frame, even for Lebanese households, as the last official population census was conducted in 1932. Typically, such a sample frame consists of the universe of enumeration areas in a country, with associated estimates of population. This meant that we had to construct our own sample frame by selecting a few Small Area Units (SAUs) and then conducting a full listing operation by visiting every household within the selected SAUs and collecting basic demographic and contact information. The second difficulty was that there was no available cartographic division of the country into geographic areas small enough to be the subject of a full listing operation, which could then serve as a sampling frame for the SAUs. Circonscription Foncières (CF) were the finest level of disaggregation available; CFs are generally too large to be listed as some have populations of over 100,000. Finally, there was no available sampling frame for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which meant that we had to depend on UNHCR data on registered Syrian refugees, combined with the estimates of Lebanese population at the CF level.

Specifically, the Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains one of the largest concentrations of refugees per capita in the world. A series of overlapping political, economic and social crises in Lebanon has underpinned the vastly growing level of need across populations in the country. On the macroeconomic front, at the beginning of July 2022 the World Bank downgraded Lebanon to a lower-middle-income country for the first time in 27 years, after Lebanon’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had decreased from $55 billion in 2018 to $20.5 billion in 2021.1 The Lebanese lira has continued to lose value in 2022, reaching exchange rates close to LBP 43,000 to the United States dollar in the informal market in December 2022. The country depends heavily on imports, paid for in dollars; fluctuations in exchange rates thus have significant impacts on the prices of goods and services in the country. Inflation is still on the rise: between October 2019 and the time of data collection in June 2022 the Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change of prices over time, rose by 1,066 per cent. In addition to these factors, the COVID-19 and more recent Cholera outbreaks have stretched the country’s health sector and resources to breaking point. As a result, Lebanon’s financial and humanitarian situation ranks among the most severe crises in the world today.

The 2022 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) is the tenth annual representative survey assessing the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with the aim to identify changes and trends in their vulnerabilities. Since its first round of data collection and assessment, the VASyR has become an essential tool for planning, shaping decision-making and the design of needs-based programmes. The results of the VASyR are used by the 10 sectors in partnership under the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), in order to understand the situational changes in Lebanon and advocate for funding. The VASyR has also been used to build targeting models, for instance to predict socioeconomic vulnerability and allocate assistance accordingly.

Likewise, the sample was stratified by location and population groups based on country of origin helping to account for the different economic realities from one part of the country to another, as well as differences between nationalities. Following discussion with the UNHCR country team and regional bureau, three geographic regions were presented for consideration : a) Southern Mexico; b) Mexico City; and c) the Northern and Central Industrial Corridor. Additionally, partners expressed interest in the Venezuelan community as a separate group, primarily residing in Mexico City, Monterrey and Cancun. The population of the four groups represents 67% of the active registered refugees in Mexico. Out of the 35,140 refugee households in the four regions, 26,688 families have at least one phone number representing an overall high rate of phone penetration. Across regions of interest, Hondurans make up the single largest group of PoC in Southern Mexico (38%), and the Northern and Central Industrial Corridor (43%), whereas Venezuelans make up over half of the PoC population in Mexico City (52%). Based on the above, a sampling strategy based on four separate strata was proposed in order to adequately represent the regions and sub-groups of interest: 1. Southern Mexico – Honduran and El Salvadoran PoC population 2. Mexico City – Honduran, El Salvadoran and Cuban PoC population 3. Northern and Central Industrial Corridor – Hondurans and El Salvadoran PoC population 4. Venezuelan Population – Mexico City, Monterey (Nuevo Leon) and Cancun (Quintana Roo) A comparable sub-sample of the national population in the same locations PoC were sampled was also generated using random digit dialing (RDD).

UNHCR Malaysia conducted the survey in December 2022 with the help of 23 enumerators and successfully collected data from 718 households comprising of 1,760 individuals. Informed consent was obtained prior to the start of the interview. 
The average age of the respondents was 34 years (SD = 9 years). Majority of the households were male-headed (87%), married (55%), currently in some form of employment (83%) and originated from Myanmar (74%). Among the head of households, knowledge of available health services were lacking with a third of them (30.8%) unaware of subsidized care at government health facilities for UNHCR document holders while more than half of them were unaware of the availability of hospitalization assistance as provided by IMARET. Nevertheless, most households were able to access health care when needed (93%) although affordability remained a major barrier.  The average amount paid by households for primary health services was MYR164 while hospitalization care could cost as much as MYR5,197 on average. In terms of childhood vaccination, 78% children under 5 were able to receive measles or MMR vaccination mainly from government health facilities. However, it is worth noting that the finding did not indicate whether the children had completed the required doses for MMR. Access to reproductive health services remain challenging with slightly more than half of pregnant women faced difficulties accessing antenatal care due to financial barrier.

The sampling frame consisted of a list of wards with IDP household counts in the six states, provided by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) 2017.

The sample had 6 strata with each state as a stratum. Each stratum was divided into grids of 150 by 150 meters using GIS technology defining the enumeration areas (EAs). The number of EAs to be selected from each stratum was obtained proportional to the IDP population sizes in each state. 
For the IDP sample, the EAs consisted of two types of IDP settlements, which were host community settings and camp settings. A total of 111 EAs across the 6 states were randomly selected proportional to size. Out of these, 77 EAs were host community type EAs and 48 were camp-like EAs.
For the host community sample of 1,500 households, EAs were restricted to the 77 host community type EAs that were selected based on IDPs population numbers, in the absence of residential population estimates at this level. The survey is representative for IDPs and host communities, defining host communities as the non-displaced population living in the EAs with displaced populations.

All the households in the selected EAs were first listed, and 12 IDP households and 12 (or multiples of it) host community households were randomly selected and surveyed per EA, to reach the designated sample size.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The questionnaire contains modules on Household Member Roster, Household Characteristics, Food Consumption, Non food consumption, Livestock, Durable Goods, Wellbeing and Opinions, and Displacement. The questionnaire is available for download with the dataset.","The sampling weight is the inverse probability of selection. The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. The first-stage probability of selection for the EA is the same for the IDP and host community households. It is equal to the IDP population of the EA divided by the total number of IDPs in the stratum multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For IDPs, the second-stage probability of selection is the number of selected IDP households per EA divided by the number of listed IDP households in the EA. For host community households, the second-stage selection probability is the number of host community households selected per EA divided by the number of listed host community households in the EA.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The sampling consists of two stages, the primary sampling unit being the block, which is defined as the urban geographic area delimited by roads. The secondary sampling unit is the dwelling with at least one Venezuelan person that exists within a block. For the households that are finally selected, information is obtained from all the individuals.

The sampling frame for the blocks was constructed as follows: 
i)	The addresses of 58,067 Venezuelan people registered in the 2017 Population and Housing Census were identified. 
ii)	The addresses of 10,076 people were available registered in the registry of Venezuelans who applied for the Temporary Permit of Permanence from the National Superintendency of Migration of the Ministry of the Interior. 
iii)	The blocks containing the addresses of the aforementioned information sources were identified using the Geographic Information System. A global framework of 19,074 blocks was built. 

The concept of block used in the survey is a physical area delimited by streets, avenues, roads, canals, etc. easily identifiable and can contain one or more homes, parks, vacant lots, sports fields, etc. 

The original design of the sample included the construction of three strata based on the number of dwellings with a Venezuelan population found in each block of the sampling frame: 1 to 5, 6 to 10, greater than 10. On the other hand, the population of the city of Lima was divided into 4 zones with the following districts:

North Lima: Los Olivos, San Martn De Porres, Comas, Carabayllo, Independencia, Puente Piedra
East Lima: San Juan De Lurigancho, Ate, Santa Anita, El Agustino, San Luis, La Molina, Lurigancho

Jesus Maria, Magdalena Del Mar, San Borja
South Lima: Chorrillos, San Juan De Miraflores, Villa El Salvador, Villa Mara Del Triunfo, Lurn, Pachacamac

The housing framework was built by means of an exhaustive registry of buildings and dwellings in each of the selected blocks, identifying those places, be they dwellings or establishments, that had a population from Venezuela. The concept of housing for the purposes of the survey included private and collective dwellings (hotels, hostels, lodgings, churches and shelters), where the Venezuelan population is found. This concept is different from the one used in the regular INEI household surveys, which only considers private households with a maximum of 5 households.

The Palestinian Family Survey is a national household survey programme developed by PCBS based on international standard demographic health surveys as well as MICS surveys. The Palestinian Family Survey was conducted as part of the fourth global round of MICS surveys (MICS4).  The survey provides up to date information on the health, economic, and social situation of women and children; in addition to providing information on characteristics of the family in which each woman and child live as well as the main indicators about the categories of youth and elderly. This offers a study, analysis, and understanding of the actual indicators and their relationship with demographic, social, economic, and environmental variables. The survey also measures the major indicators which allows countries to monitor their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) besides measuring the level of fulfilling other internationally agreed upon commitments; in addition to enabling policy and decision makers, and intervention programs to evaluate the plans and programs, amend them, and locate the areas of intervention based on the results. The carry out of the survey also aims at updating the databases on women and children as well as building and enhancing the technical staff capabilities of carrying out surveys and analyzing data out of them. The Palestinian Family survey conducted in 2010 was led by a technical team from the Palestinians Central Bureau of Statistics, UNICEF, and UNFPA, and Ministry of Health.

The Palestinian Family Survey was conducted for a representative sample of the State of Palestine. The survey was designed as a multi- stage cluster covering all the State of Palestine including two geographic areas; The West Bank which included 11 governorates: (Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Nablus, Ramallah & Al-Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho & Al-Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron) and the Gaza Strip which include governorates (Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah, Deir El Balah and North Gaza). Of the 15,355 households selected in the sample, results showed that the number of occupied households were 14,817 of which 13,629 households were successfully interviewed during the survey, giving a response rate of 92 percent. There were 13,982 women in the 15-49 age group of which a total of 11,173 eligible women were successfully interviewed, achieving a response rate of 80 percent. In addition, 8,024 children were identified in the household questionnaire for whom a total of 7,900 mothers or child caretakers were interviewed. The total response rates of individual interviews are calculated as 73 percent of eligible women and 90 percent with children under 5 respectively. The total households interviewed reached (13,629) households, which included 81,510 individuals members who were listed.

Urban and rural areas and the refugee camps in each of the sixteen governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sampling frames used has been established in PCBS,and basically comprises the list of enumeration areas. (The enumeration area is a geographical area containing a number of buildings and housing units of about 120 housing units on average.)

The total frame consists of the following two parts:
1- West Bank and Gaza Sampling Frame: containing enumeration areas drawn up in 2007. In the West Bank: each enumeration area consists of a list of households with identification data to ascertain the address of individual households. In Gaza: each enumeration area contains a list of housing units with addresses to ascertain the address of individual households, plus identification data of the housing units.
2- Jerusalem Sampling Frame (J1): contains enumeration areas only, geographically divided with information about the total number of households in these areas. However, there is no detailed information about addresses inside enumeration areas and the size of the enumeration area can be ascertained without the ability to identify the addresses.

Both frames were used in the sample design and selection and therefore, the sample will differ from one frame to another. Also, the method of reaching the sample units by interviewers may differ.

In the survey, two variables were chosen to divide the population into strata, depending on the homogeneity of parts of the population.
Previous studies have shown that Palestinian households may be divided as follows:
1- Governorates: there are 16 governorates in the State of Palestine: 11 governorates in the West Bank and 5 in the Gaza Strip.
2- Locality Types: there are three types : urban, rural and refugee Camps.

After determining the sample size, which equals 15,355 households, we selected a probability sample - a multi-stage stratified cluster sample as follows:
1- First stage: selecting a sample of clusters (enumeration areas) using PPS without replacement method to obtain 644 enumeration areas from the total enumeration area frame.
2- Second stage: selecting 24 households from each selected enumeration area of the first stage and using the systematic sample method. When reaching households, all individuals were interviewed from the eligible groups i.e. women 15-54 years, elderly aged 60 years or above and children aged 0-4 years
3- Third stage: selecting one child of age group 2-14 years for part of the questionnaire and one young person from the 15-29 age group to answer the youth attachment in the questionnaireThe Kish table was used to select one child at random.
4- Also in the women's health section, the questionnaire was administered to a maximum of three randomly selected women aged 15-54 years irrespective of their marital status living in the households. In the case where 3 or less women aged 15-54 were listed in the HH all women were interviewed. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non-response cases. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non response cases.
5- The elderly age 60 years and above questionnaire was administered for all elderly persons within the household.
6- The Youth questionnaire was administered by randomly selecting a youth member from households with odd household numbers assigned at the enumeration area level. Within this sample female and male youth were alternatively selected.

The sample was allocated with proportionally using the design strata of the governorates and the locality type according to the proportion of the population in the 2007 Census.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Family Survey 2010 - Final Report"" pp.167-171.",Face-to-face,"The design of the survey complied with the standard specifications of health surveys previously implemented by PCBS. In addition, the survey included indicators of MICS4 to meet the needs of all partners.

Five sets of questionnaires were used in the survey, three are considered as main questionnaires and are based on MICS4 standard questionnaires,viz.: 1) a household questionnaire which was used to collect information on all de jure household members (usual residents), the household, and the dwelling; and a section on general health and knowledge of HIV and AIDS adminstered to three randomly selected women 15-54 years in each houehold, irrespective of marital status, 2) a women’s questionnaire administered in each household to all ever-married women aged 15-54 years (to allow for comparison with the previous survey, however, all the tables and analysis were undertaken for the women aged 15-49 only; 3) an under-5 questionnaire, administered to mothers or caretakers for all children under-5 years living in the household. The two additional country specific questionnaires were, 4) the youth aged 15-29 years old questionnaire; and 5) the elderly (60+ years old) questionnaire.

• Household Questionnaire: Covers demographic and educational characteristics, chronic disease, smoking, discipline of children (2-14 years), child labor (5-14 years), education of children (5-24 years) and housing characteristics.
• Women’s Health (15-54 years) Questionnaire: regardless of marital status, awareness about AIDS, anemia in women aged 15-49 years.
• Ever married women (15-54 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics of eligible women, reproduction, child mortality, maternal care, reproductive morbidity, family planning, and attitudes towards reproduction.
• Children under age of 5 Questionnaire: Covers children’s health, vaccination against childhood diseases, early childhood development, chronic disease, and anemia.

Supplementary Questionnaires
• Youth (15-29 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, awareness and perception of family planning, health status, awareness about sexually transmitted diseases and reproduction.
• Elderly (60 years and over) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, social relations, activities, time-use, health status, and use of mass media.

The main three questionnaires (household, women and children under-5) are based on the MICS4 model questionnaires. Using the Arabic version of the MICS4 statndard questionnaires, the questionnaires were customized to the local context and were piloted in February 2010. Based on the results of the pilot, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires.","Sampling weights are necessary to make the results of the sample are representative to the target population, and to adjust the bias resulting from differences between the sample characteristics and the reference population characteristics which mainly coming from the non-response and non-coverage of the frame.

The steps of calculation the design weight:
1- In the first stage: the weight of enumeration areas (PSUs) were calculated depending on the probability of each enumeration area((PPS) sample selection).
2- In the second stage: the weight of households were calculated in each enumeration area.
3- Design households weights resulted from product of weights of first stage and second stage.
4- Merging design households weights to the households file and to the household individuals file, each individual obtained the weight of his/her household weight ,and it is considered initial weight for individuals (all households members)

Adjustment of sample weights for non-response:
The weights of the households and individuals were adjusted to non-response cases, which are explained in the result of the interview, and we got the adjusted weights for non- response of the sample.
The adjustment factor for household non-response is equal to:
Fnr = sample of occupied households in stratum h /sample of interviewed households in stratum h
Similarly, the adjustment factor for non-response at the individual level (women and under-5 children) for each stratum is equal to:
Fnr = Eligible women (or under-5s) in stratum h /Completed women’s (or under-5’s) questionnaires in stratum h These factors were multiplied by the design weights to get the adjusted weights for non-response.

Weights Calibration (post-stratification):
This form of weighting adjustment compensates for differences between the achieved distribution for the sample for some characteristic and known population distribution for that characteristic (hlweight). The source of distributions are population counts from projections. Furthermore, the population in the control totals should match the population surveyed. For example, if a population was excluded from the survey due to age groups, the same population should be excluded from the projections. the post-stratification method of adjustment was used to compensate for non-coverage.

Standardization of weights:
Standardized weights obtained from dividing the weights of the sample unit by the average of the weights, so the weights were standardized in such way that the total weighted sample interviewed is equal to the total unweighted.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

B) The type of locality: city, village and refugee camp.

Sample Design and Type

Three Stage Stratified Cluster Sample of 2022 persons (2022 households). The sample design was as follows:
1. Stage one: selection a sample of 60 representative localities covering all strata.
2. Stage two: selection a random sample of Palestinian households from each location selected in the first stage.
3. Stage three: random selection of one person from each household using Kish table within the age group of 18 years old and above. Half of the sample will be male and half is female respondents.

Sample Size
The sample size was 2022 persons from all Palestinian territories aged 18 years and above. Main regions covered by the sample are: the West Bank (excluding Ramallah), Ramallah and Gaza Strip. The sample was distributed as follows:

Region  / # of Households 

Ramallah and Al Bireh 350 
West Bank 1000 
Gaza Strip 672 
Total 2022 

The margin of error in the main key variables is approximately 2.5% on the entire sample size and it should be bigger in the detailed domains.

Sample Representation:

The researchers ensured that the sample is representative of the following during the field work:

1) Geographical representation: the sample distribution covers all governorates of the West Bank (including Jerusalem) and Gaza strip, thus provides a comprehensive geographical representation.
2) Economic Activity: in general, Ramallah and Al Bireh governorate is considered the economic and commercial center and thus was given a higher weight in the sample compared to the rest of the localities.
3) Economic Sectors: the sample covered different economical sectors such as employees of industrial, services and commercial sectors (usually in the main cities), workers in the agricultural sector (rural areas) and workers in the informal sector (mostly in Gaza).
4) Poverty levels: the sample covers poor localities as provided by statistics. In general, Gaza is considered poorer than the West Bank. Also, refugee camps and some localities particularly in North West Bank are considered poorer than the rest of localities and the above sample distribution provides coverage of such localities.
5) Age Groups: the sample covered all age groups above the age of 18. The reason behind selecting the starting age to be 18 is the fact that it is within this age that an individual is expected to become involved with financial transactions and thus will be dealing with financial services.
6) Gender: the sample was gender balanced; half of the respondents were males and half were females. This corresponds with the gender distribution of the Palestinian Territories.
7) Infrastructure: the sample covered central and remote localities to guarantee representation of poor versus good infrastructure and availability of services including financial services.",Face-to-face,"A standard questionnaire was previously developed by the World Bank and was adapted to the Palestinian context by Riyada Consulting.

Technical and financial support was provided by the Palestinian Government, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

The global MICS programme was developed by UNICEF in the 1990s as an international household survey programme to support countries in the collection of internationally comparable data on a wide range of indicators on the situation of children and women. MICS surveys measure key indicators that allow countries to generate data for use in policies and programmes, and to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed upon commitments.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey has as its primary objectives:
- To furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward goals established in the Millennium Declaration and other internationally agreed upon goals, as a basis for future action.
- To contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Palestine and to strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2014 was conducted for a representative sample of Palestine. The survey was designed as a multi- stage cluster sample covering the entire country including two geographic regions; The West Bank which includes 11 governorates: (Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Salfit, Nablus, Ramallah and Al Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho and Al Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron) and Gaza Strip which includes 5 governorates (Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah, Deir El Balah and North Gaza) and was stratified according to urban, rural and camp areas.

Of the 11,125 households selected in the sample, results showed that the number of occupied households were 10,568 of which 10,182 households were successfully interviewed during the survey, giving a response rate of 96 percent. There were 13,964 women in the 15-49 age group of which a total of 13,367 eligible women were successfully interviewed, achieving a response rate of 96 percent. In addition, the number of children was 7,919 child in the Household Questionnaire of which a total of 7,816 child were interviewed giving a response rate of 99 percent. The total households interviewed included 56,367 individual members who were listed. Of these, 28,542 were males and 27,825 were females with a sex ratio of 103 males per hundred females.

It is noted that the Palestinian population is a young one. The percentage of individuals in the age group 0-17 years was 46 percent, whereas the percentage of individuals in the age group 18 and above was 54 percent. According to economic and social dependency categories, 39 percent individuals were in the age group 0-14 years, 58 percent in the age group 15-64 years which is the age category of economically active individuals; and 3 percent in the age group 65 years and over. The average household size in Palestine in 2014 was about 5.5 persons. About 91 percent of households are headed by men and about 9 percent of households are headed by women. The findings pertain to March-April 2014, when the fieldwork was conducted.",2014-03-2014-0,"- Individuals

- Women: Woman’s Background, Fertility/Birth History, Desire for Last Birth, Maternal and Newborn Health, Post-natal Health Checks, Contraception, Unmet Need, Marriage and HIV/AIDS;
- Children: Age, Birth Registration, Early Childhood Development, Breastfeeding and Dietary Intake, Immunization, Care of Illness and Anthropometry.",Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics,"The primary objective of the sample design for the Palestinian MICS was to produce statistically reliable estimates of most indicators, at the national level, for urban, rural and camps areas. Urban, rural and camps areas in each of the governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sample size for the Palestinian MICS was calculated as 11,125 households. For the calculation of the sample size, the key indicator used was stunting prevalence among children age 0-4 years.

The number of households selected per cluster for the Palestinian MICS was determined as 25 households, based on a number of considerations, including the design effect, the budget available, and the time that would be needed per team to complete one cluster. Dividing the total number of households by the number of sample households per cluster, we obtain a sample of 445 clusters.

The 2007 census frame was used for the selection of clusters. Census enumeration areas were defined as primary sampling units (PSUs), and were selected from each of the sampling strata by using systematic pps (probability proportional to size) sampling procedures, based on the number of households in each enumeration area from the 2007 Population and Housing Census frame. The first stage of sampling was thus completed by selecting the required number of enumeration areas from each of the sixteen governorates, separately for the urban, rural and camps strata.

Since the sampling frame (the 2007 census) was not up-to-date, a listing of households was conducted in all the sample enumeration areas (EAs) prior to the selection of households. For this purpose, listing teams were formed who visited all of the selected enumeration areas and listed all households in these enumeration areas. The listing was conducted in 416 enumeration areas; this excludes 29 sample EAs in Jerusalem within the barriers J1. A total of 266 EAs were updated in the West Bank area and 150 EAs in the Gaza Strip. A 5-day training took place during the first week of September in order to provide the fieldworkers with the skills needed for conducting the listing in the sample EAs for the Palestinian Multiple Indicator Survey 2014. The main listing field work was conducted during the period September - October, 2014.

Lists of households were prepared by the listing teams in the field for each enumeration area. The households were then sequentially numbered from 1 to n (the total number of households in each enumeration area) at the Central Statistical Office, where the selection of 25 households in each enumeration area was carried out using random systematic selection procedures.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014 - Final Report"" pp.203-207.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaires for the Generic MICS were structured questionnaires based on the MICS5 model questionnaire with some modifications and additions. Household questionnaires were administered in each household, which collected various information on household members including sex, age and relationship. The household questionnaire includes List of Household Members, Education, Child Discipline, Household Characteristics, Water and Sanitation and Salt Iodization.

In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women age 15-49 and children under age five. The questionnaire was administered to the mother or primary caretaker of the child.

The women's questionnaire includes Woman's Background, Fertility/Birth History, Desire for Last Birth, Maternal and Newborn Health, Post-natal Health Checks, Contraception, Unmet Need, Marriage and HIV/AIDS.

The children's questionnaire includes Child's Age, Birth Registration, Early Childhood Development, Breastfeeding and Dietary Intake, Immunization, Care of Illness and Anthropometry.

The questionnaires are based on the MICS5 model questionnaire. From the MICS5 model English version, the questionnaires were customised and translated into Arabic and were pre-tested in December, 2013 in 4 clusters, out of each cluster 25 households were selected for interview, 25 households in Al-Bireh city and 25 households in Ramallah city (Urban), 25 households in Abu-Qash village (rural) and 25 in Al-Jalazoun refugee camp (refugee camps). The clusters were covered Ramallah governorate in the central of the West Bank. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires. In addition to the administration of questionnaires, fieldwork teams tested the salt used for cooking in the households for iodine content, observed the place for handwashing, and measured the weights and heights of children age under 5 years.","The Palestinian MICS sample is not self-weighting. Essentially, by allocating equal numbers of households to each of the regions, different sampling fractions were used in each region since the sizes of the regions varied. For this reason sample weights were calculated and these were used in the subsequent analyses of the survey data.

The major component of the weight is the reciprocal of the sampling fraction employed in selecting the number of sample households in the particular sampling stratum and PSU.

A final component in the calculation of sample weights takes into account the level of nonresponse for the household and individual interviews. The adjustment for household nonresponse in each stratum is equal to: 1/RRh
where RRh is the response rate for the sample households in stratum h, defined as the proportion of the number of interviewed households in stratum h out of the number of selected households found to be occupied during the fieldwork in stratum h.

The non-response adjustment factors for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires were applied to the adjusted household weights. Numbers of eligible women and under-5 children were obtained from the roster of household members in the Household Questionnaire for households where interviews were completed.

The design weights for the households were calculated by multiplying the inverse of the probabilities of selection by the non-response adjustment factor for each enumeration area. These weights were then standardized (or normalized), one purpose of which is to make the weighted sum of the interviewed sample units equal to the total sample size at the national level. Normalization is achieved by dividing the full sample weights (adjusted for nonresponse) by the average of these weights across all households at the national level. This is performed by multiplying the sample weights by a constant factor equal to the unweighted number of households at the national level divided by the weighted total number of households (using the full sample weights adjusted for nonresponse). A similar standardization procedure was followed in obtaining normalized weights for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires. Adjusted (normalized) household weights varied between 0.226 and 2.316 in the 445 sample enumeration areas (clusters).

Sample weights were appended to all data sets and analyses were performed by weighting households, women, or under-5s with these sample weights.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

In 2020, an estimated 2.5 million people were internally displaced and close to 400,000 Darfuris refugees resided in neighbouring countries. The political transition following years of conflict paved the way for the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA) in 2020. The peace agreement aims to address the root causes of conflict but also establishes durable solutions for displaced populations as a necessity for lasting peace in Darfur. In 2021, the Government furthermore initiated work on a National Strategy on Solutions, which will offer a critical strategic framework and operational roadmap towards solutions for displaced communities in Sudan. 
In 2017, the Government of Sudan (GoS) and the international community agreed on the need to collectively support Durable Solutions for IDPs, returnees, and their host communities to end the situation of protracted displacement. The collaboration on Durable Solutions between the GoS and international community resulted in two Durable Solution pilots in respectively El Fasher (North Darfur) and Um Dukhun (Central Darfur). 
JIPS provided technical support for the scale-up of the durable solutions analysis across Darfur under the Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF). Focusing on nine localities, including urban areas, the data collection exercises build directly on the durable solutions analysis approach piloted in El Fasher in 2019. The Durable Solutions Working Group (DSWG) identified a joint evidence base and a collaborative approach as priorities and therefore undertook a joint area-based profiling exercise, focusing on the Abu Shouk and El Salaam IDP camps on the outskirts of El Fasher. The focus was set on profiling of IDPs (in camp settlements and out of camps), IDP returnees, refugee returnees, and non-displaced. The profiling exercises are aimed at:

The sampling followed a stratified multi-stage sampling approach in which villages were the primary sampling unit (PSU) and households were the secondary sampling unit (SSU), while stratification was done by target group. Accordingly, the first sampling stage consisted of selecting a sample of villages with probabilities that were proportional to size; villages with higher numbers of households had a higher probability of being selected for the survey. A random sample of households was then selected based on two approaches: systematic skips or systematic snowballing. This depended on the spatial distribution of the target groups in each
village. For example, in all camps and return villages where only IDPs reside, systematic skips were done. In villages with more target groups, systematic snowballing was performed for each target group.

Sampling limitations & specifications
- The sampling is designed to produce results representative for each target group in the locality. Analysis at the village level is not possible and therefore no reference to villages or breakdown by villages is done in the report.
- The locations targeted for the survey were not selected randomly across the localities and thus do not necessarily provide representative results of all settlement situations in the localities. The targeting of location has been based on a conflict sensitive approach and the programmatic scope of the PBF. However, the area level analysis has looked at locality as a whole and thus ounterbalance the survey scope which focused on the displaced target groups.",Face-to-face interview: Mobile,NA,NA,"PBF Sudan, DSWG Sudan, UNHCR, JIPS (2021).

The commitment is rooted in the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) from 2011, signed by the Government of Sudan, other major parties to the conflict and the international community, and which sets out the framework for peace in Darfur. The peace agreement and the Darfur Development Strategy (DDS) that followed constitute political commitments to support durable peace and development in Darfur. This pledge has resulted in piloting a durable solutions process in El Fasher in North Darfur.
To reach durable solutions and end displacement, long-term planning based on agreed and jointly-owned comprehensive data is needed. To establish an agreed evidence base, a collaborative profiling approach was adopted that brought actors together to ensure trust and ownership of the results of the profiling exercise. An important aspect of this durable solutions profiling is that it places IDPs centre-stage alongside the two other major stakeholdersthe Government of Sudan and the international communitypermitting the profiling results and recommendations to be owned and signed off by all parties. The durable solutions profiling exercise in El Fasher makes up step two: getting better informed about the displacement affected communities in the five-stage durable solutions process. The survey included 3002 households. It specifically aims to:  provide a comprehensive profile of IDPs residing in Abu Shouk and El Salaam IDP camps; develop a better understanding of IDPs vulnerabilities, coping mechanisms, capacities and provide insight into IDPs perceptions and their future settlement intentions; provide a jointly agreed upon data set to help inform durable solutions programming responses;  pilot a profiling exercise of displacement and joint durable solutions planning that could be replicated in other Sudan contexts with displaced populations.",2018-05-01-2018-07-3,Household and individual,Abu Shouk and El Salam IDP Camps,Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey includes the following topics:

The four strata were divided into clusters of similar population size, based on a grid developed on a map of the areas. Clusters were selected from each stratum with a uniform probability of selection. The sampling was conducted in this manner, because there was no reliable population data available which would have made sampling probabilities to size possible. All the households in the selected enumeration areas were listed, while 12 were selected for interviews in each cluster in simple random draws. The listing exercise resulted in a significantly lower number of clusters than was planned. To compensate for the lower number of clusters, some of the listed clusters were selected for oversampling.

The sampling procedure had two steps. The sample was stratified according to the 18 pre-war regions—which are the country’s first-level administrative divisions—and population types. This resulted in 57 strata, of which 7 are IDP, 17 are nomadic, 16 are exclusively urban strata, 15 exclusively rural, and 2 are combined urban-rural strata. The sample size in some strata was too small, thus urban and rural areas were merged into one single strata; this was the case for Sool and Sanaag.

Round 1 of the COVID-19 SHFPS was implemented between June and July 2020. The survey interviewed 2,811 households (1,735 urban households, 611 rural households, 435 nomadic households, and 30 IDP households in settlements). The sample of 2,811 households was contacted using a random digit dialing protocol. The sampling frame was the SHFPS Round 1 data - the same households from Round 1 are tracked over time, allowing for the monitoring of the well-being of households in near-real time and enabling an evidence-based response to the COVID-19 crisis. 

Round 2 of the COVID-19 SHFPS was implemented in January 2021. A total of 1,756 households were surveyed (738 urban households, 647 rural households, 309 nomadic households, and 62 IDP households in settlements). Of the 1,756 households, 91 percent were successfully re-contacted from Round 1, with the remainder reached via random digit dialing. Administration of the questionnaire took on average 30 minutes.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],"The questionnaire of the COVID-19 Somali High-Frequency Phone Survey (SHFPS) of households consists of the following sections:

- Interview information (R1, R2)
- Household roster (R1, R2)
- Knowledge regarding the spread of COVID-19 (R1, R2)
- Behavior and social distancing (R1, R2)
- Concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic (R1, R2)

- Social assistance and safety nets (R1, R2)
- Interaction with internally displaced persons (R2)","To ensure the representativeness of the distribution of Somali households by state and population type, each household observation was adjusted by a sampling weight.

Based on the sampling design, sampling weights were calculated after the completion of data collection. Sampling weights were calculated with two goals: i) to correct for the selection bias generated by the Random Digit Dialing (RDD) protocol, namely to correct for the under-coverage of households that do not have access to a mobile phone, and ii) to ensure representativeness of the distribution of Somali households by state and population type. The first is achieved using a Propensity Score Weighting (PSW) methodology. To this end, the probability of being included in the phone survey is estimated and observations with a lower probability of being included are given a higher weight. The second is achieved using a post-stratification methodology. The final weight combines a propensity score weight and a post-stratification weight.

In Round 2, cross-sectional weights (CSW) were calculated for all households interviewed in round 2.

The sample in the settlements was stratified by population group and was representative at the total population level. The distribution of each population group was proportionate to their size in each settlement and was considered when distributing the sample across the settlements. For the IDPs from South Central Somalia and refugees/asylum seekers, a non- probabilistic sampling approach was adopted due to the relatively small size of these population groups and scattered distribution in the urban area of Hargeisa. For the IDPs originating from south- central Somalia and residing in the urban areas of Hargeisa outside of the known settlements, the profiling deployed respondent- driven sampling, whereby the individuals being surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know. In turn, the next individuals surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know, and so forth (snowball sampling).

The FDS is comparable across countries over time and aligned with international statistical standards. It has the purpose of providing actionable evidence to inform the government’s operational and policy-related data needs, as well as its humanitarian and development partners.   
As a multi-topic survey, the FDS collected household and individual level data on the socioeconomic characteristics and living conditions of targeted populations. Data was collected through face-to-face household interviews,  where up to four household members aged 15 and above were interviewed: (1) the head of the household or a household member who was knowledgeable about the household; (2) a randomly selected household member who provided information about individual life experiences; (3) the caregiver of a randomly selected child under five years of age; and (4) a randomly selected woman who gave birth in the last two years. 
South Sudan was the first pilot country where FDS has been implemented. South Sudan hosted refugees since its independence in 2011, despite facing multiple social challenges and internal conflicts. By April 2024 South Sudan hosted 450,000 refugees, mostly from Sudan, Burundi, the Central African Republic, and other countries.
The FDS in South Sudan collected data on a nationally representative sample of registered refugees and on a sample of the national population living in proximity of refugees located in the north of South Sudan. Data collection occurred between April and December 2023. The final realized sample of the FDS in South Sudan was composed of around 3,000 households, all located in rural areas. Among them, 68 per cent are refugee households and 32 per cent belong to host communities.

The host sample initial sample adjustment weights include adjustment for proximity to offset the differential probabilities of selection based on proximity of the buildings to the boundary of the refugee camp. Furthermore, the adjustment also included an adjustment for a household owning more than one building (based on the self-reported proxy collected during interview).

The first stage weights were further adjusted for structural differences between the sample and the administrative make of each stratum – i.e. the samples within each stratum resembled the population of each stratum. These weights are rescaled to the size of stratum as sampled.
•	wgh_samp_resc_str is the household weight restructured within each stratum, while maintaining the sampled size of each stratum (rescaled) – these weights are best for comparative analysis among the strata or analysis within each stratum.
•	wgh_samp_resc_pop is the wgh_samp_resc_str post-stratified to the structure of the population, disregarding the sample size of the strata (i.e. adjusting strata sizes in the sample to their population proportions) and rescaled to the total sample size – these weights are best used for national level analysis.

Similarly the weights were estimated for all the observational levels of the data:
•	wgh_str_rr is a weight for a random respondent of age 15 and above restructured within sampling strata (this weight also reflects adjustment of differential household sizes)

In the HFS, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum estimated using the 2008 census. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA over the number of listed households in the EA. Sampling weights were then scaled to equal the number of households per strata using the Census 2008 data. 

In the CRS, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of structures in the EA divided by the number of structures in the stratum multiplied by the number of EAs selected in the stratum. The number of structures was estimated using satellite imagery of the strata (camps). The selection probability of a household within the EA is decomposed into the selection probability of a block within the EA, the selection probability of a structure within a block, and the selection probability of a household within a structure. The sampling weights are then scaled to equal the number of structures per stratum as per the satellite imagery.

An estimated 140,000 South Sudanese spontaneously returnees are reported to have returned to South Sudan from November 2018 to date.

The South Sudan situation continues to be characterized as a children's tragedy with children constituting over 65 percent of the refugee population.

In November 2018, it was agreed during the Kampala Representatives meeting that intention surveys should be conducted for South Sudanese refugees in all countries of asylum. This was further concretized in March 2019, during the EHA/GLR planning meeting; here it was decided that UNHCR country representations of CAR, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Sudan, Ethiopia would ensure that a rapid intention survey of South Sudanese refugees in their respective asylum countries is carried out before May 2019, in line with the agreed calendar of the R-ARCSS

UNHCR in collaboration with AHA, IRC and WFP carried out the nutrition survey in Pamir and Ajoung Thok refugee camps from 21 to 31 October 2019. Pamir and Ajoung Thok are the official refugee camps in Pariang County, Unity State. No nutrition survey was carried out in Yida as comprehensive services were not provided in 2019 considering its exit strategy. Refugees from Yida continue to be relocated to Pamir and
Ajoung Thok refugee camps. The overall aim of the survey was to assess the nutrition situation among the refugee population and to monitor ongoing programme interventions. In each of the camps a cross- sectional survey was conducted using the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) version 2, 2013 guidelines (http://sens.unhcr.org/) and the Standardised Monitoring and Assessments of Relief and Transitions (SMART) guidelines (https://smartmethodology.org/). Systematic random sampling was used to identify the survey respondents.

The surveys had a total of 4 modules consisting of 3 individual level and 1 household level questionnaires following UNHCR SENS guidelines version 2, 2013. The modules included: 
1. Anthropometry and health targeting all children aged 6 to 59 months in all the sampled households; 
2. Anaemia targeting all children aged 6 to 59 months in all the sampled households and all non-pregnant women aged 15 to 49 years in every other sampled household, 
3. Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) targeting all children aged 0 to 23 months in all the sampled households; 
4. Food security targeting every other sampled household. 

The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and mosquito net coverage modules were not carried out. This is because there is a WASH monitoring system in place and WASH Knowledge Attitude and Practices (KAP) assessment was conducted within the same month as the nutrition survey.

This can be explained by the security challenges caused by tensions in neighboring countries and by the macroeconomic situation of the country itself. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the livelihood of this already vulnerable population due to loss of means of income and reduction of revenues and support. In this context, the 2021 SENS survey was organized by UNHCR and the WFP, in collaboration with Chad Health Ministry. The data collection took place between June 17 and July 22, 2021 and covered 25 camps of Sudanese, Central African and Nigerian refugees in the East, South, and Lake Regions of Chad, including host villages living 25 Kilometers around the camps. A total of 705 clusters of 15320 households were surveyed, including 13087 children between 0 and 59 months of age who were surveyed for Anthropometry.

Additional indicators on child health such as immunization, vitamin A supplementation, incidence of diarrhoea in the past two weeks, infant and young child feeding practices (IYCF) and anaemia prevalence among children aged 6- 59 months and non -pregnant women aged 15 - 59 years, household food security, WASH, Mosquito net coverage and mortality were also assessed. 

The survey employed the Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology in accordance with the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey guidelines V2 2013. Multi-stage cluster sampling method was applied to select households in Nyarugusu and Mtendeli camps whereas simple random sampling was used in Nduta refugee camps.

Currently there are three refugee camps namely Nyarugusu (comprising of Old and New Camps) located in Kasulu, Nduta in Kibondo district and Mtendeli in Kakonko district. 
The oldest refugee camp is Nyarugusu which has been hosting refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi since 1996. Refugees from Burundi were repatriated voluntarily in 2012 leading to closure of some of the existing camps. The remainder population in need of protection were relocated to Nyarugusu camp where the total population then was about 65,000 as of early April 2015 majority being Congolese refugees and other minority nationalities such as Rwandese, Sudanese, Ugandans, and Kenyans. 

The refugee situation changed in 2015 following the political instability after the general elections in Burundi leading exodus of some Burundians to Tanzania and other neighbouring countries. As from late April 2015 higher numbers of refugees from Burundi started arriving in Tanzania mainly through a tiny border village along Lake Tanganyika and other entry points in Kigoma region. After the influx, the total population increased causing congestion in Nyarugusu camp calling for the re-opening two camps; Nduta camp on the 7th October 2015 and Mtendeli camp on 14th January 2016. 
Nyarugusu currently hosts Congolese refugees (Old Camp) and 39.4% of the Burundi refugees (New Camp) who arrived at the onset of the emergency. Nduta hosts an estimated population of 123,673 refugees who were relocated from Nyarugusu and Mtendeli hosts 52,004 who were relocated from Nyarugusu and is still receiving the new arrivals. According to UNHCR ProGres data August 2017, the total number of refugees in Kigoma Region is estimated to be 310,735. 

A total 4 surveys were conducted from 21st Aug to 18th Sept 2017 covering Nyarugusu Old Camp, Nyarugusu New Camp, Nduta and Mtendeli. UNHCR coordinated the survey in collaboration with WFP, UNICEF, WVI, Tanzania Red-cross Society (TRCS), MSF as well as Ministry of interior and Health of the United Republic of Tanzania.

Despite facing its own economic challenges, for decades Tanzania has welcomed thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring countries of Great Lakes Region. The counties geographic proximity to the strife-torn Congo Basin is responsible in part for the ease access of displaced populations. As well Tanzania was an early signatory in the region to international agreements on the rights and welfare of refugee and asylum seekers.
 
As of December, 2018, Tanzania host some 284,300 camp-based refugees, 77% of who are children and woman, in Nduta, Nyarugusu and Mtendeli Refugee Camps in Kigoma region in Northwest Tanzania. About 74% are from Burundi, and the remaining 26% are primarily from Democratic republic of Congo. 

Following a Tripartite Commission meeting in August 2017, the governments of Tanzania, Burundi, and UNHCR agreed to assist refugees who wish to voluntarily repatriate from Tanzania to Burundi. A subsequent meeting in March 2018 reaffirmed the commitment of both governments and UNHCR to uphold the principle of voluntariness, and noted that while some refugees may opt to return, others will continue to be in need of international protection. The March 2018 Tripartite meeting also produced a work plan entailing the repatriation of approximately 2,000 refugees per week from 5 April to 31 December 2018. As from January to 30th September 2018, a total of 52,260 refugees were assisted to voluntarily repatriate to Burundi from Tanzania in 88 Convoys; bringing the total repatriated from September 2017 to 57,865 of which 57.2% are children.

Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.

Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).

Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. 
Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.

Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. 

Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin. Similarly, internal movement within Uganda and opportunities to migrate to a new country are areas in which refugees say they lack guidance from humanitarian agencies or other actors.",2019-10-08-2019-10-3,Individuals and households,"Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma)",Sample survey data [ssd],Admission and rights; emergency response and ongoing needs; resilience and self-reliance; expanded solutions; voluntary repatriation; demographics.,Ground Truth Solutions,"This survey is the third round of questions Ground Truth Solutions has asked in Uganda; the first round took place in 2017 and the second in 2018. As in previous rounds, respondents to the current round of questions have been selected randomly, but the respondents themselves are different from those in previous rounds. When designing the sampling strategy for this survey, we used the most recent figures for populations of refugees from the UNHCR refugee portal. Based on this data, we decided to focus on South Sudanese and Congolese refugees, as they made up 92% of all the refugees in Uganda at the time. Refugees from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia each made up 0-3% of the overall refugee population and were excluded from this study. This is not to say that the perspectives of more marginal groups are not important, but rather that gathering these perspectives was simply beyond the scope of our research in view of the geographical and time constraints involved. In terms of the locations selected, we decided to include Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja (and to exclude Kampala, Lobule, Oruchinga, and Palabek), as over 90% of South Sudanese and Congolese refugees reside in these refugee settlements, according to UNHCR's most recent figures. 

The actual sample size achieved was 1,511 participants from 10 refugee settlements across Uganda, and the sample size in each settlement was proportional to the population size of the targeted communities within any given settlement. Using a confidence level of 95%, this sample size affords an expected margin of error of 3%. 

Ground Truth Solutions co-led enumerator training and supervised data collection on the ground. Within each of the 10 selected settlements, we chose particular zones from which to collect data, and within these zones, we selected smaller village/cluster units. In selecting the zones, we grouped them into two or three tiers, depending on the population size within the given zones of the camp, and asked the data collection partner to select one zone from each tier in order to capture responses from differently sized areas. Within the zones, a GTS supervisor, in consultation with local leaders and actors on the ground, selected the villages/clusters based on several factors, such as when they were established, their distance from central points, and their population size.",Face-to-face,"Survey questions were developed to help understand refugees’ perceptions of the aid they receive, their relationship with humanitarian workers and the host community, and their future prospects.

Between April and June 2015 UNHCR installed some three dozen community lights in 50% of Rhino Camp’s 14 villages. As demand for community lighting far exceeded available funds, UNHCR worked with the refugee community and its partner the Danish Refugee Council to prioritize the strategic placement of lights within villages. The partners jointly selected locations where (1) refugees were prone to nighttime violence, theft or other safety risks, and (2) lights would promote constructive night-time activity.

Using a 72-question survey, researchers asked respondents what day- and night-time6 activities they and their children do, and whether they do these activities in lit or unlit locations. Researchers then asked respondents if they feared or had been victims of something bad while doing these activities. The phrase something bad is the English translation for the most commonly used expressions – in Nuer, Dinka, Bari, and Kiswahili – of being a victim of an aggressive act or encountering danger.

The report also incorporates findings on needs among refugee and host community populations living in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The findings and analysis from this report has been used to support the Refugee Response Plan for 2019-2020, along with informing other programmatic, strategic, and operational decision making for the humanitarian response coordinators and partner organisations. The JMSNA aims to compare humanitarian needs across population groups and locations in order to highlight groups and areas of most concern. Consequently, it aims to answer the following research question: what is the situation for specific population groups (refugees residing within refugee settlements and host community populations) in Uganda regarding health and nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); livelihoods, environment and energy; shelter, site planning, and non-food items; education; and food security.

The JMSNA process in Uganda began in February 2018, with REACH facilitating the research design under the auspices of UNHCR and Uganda’s Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). Through the inter-agency coordination group and other coordination mechanisms, a collaborative tool was developed with input from many partners. Data collection was conducted from 2 April to 14 July, 2018, in all 30 refugee settlements. Data collection was carried out in Kampala from 6 to 16 March and 28 March to 9 April to assess the needs of refugee and host community households in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

▪ National
▪ Urban and rural areas
▪ 15 regions
▪ Although they were not included as separate sampling domains, the overall sample size permitted estimates to be produced for the 14 ongoing indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention districts: Bugiri, Kaberamaido, Koboko, Lira, Otuke, Serere, Tororo, Alebtong, Amolatar, Budaka, Butaleja, Dokolo, Namutumba, and Paliisa and 11 former IRS intervention districts Oyam, Kole, Nwoya, Amuru, Agago, Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Omoro, Apac, and Lamwo.
▪ Refugee settlements in Adjumani, Arua, Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kiryandongo, Kyegegwa, Lamwo, Moyo, and Yumbe districts were included as a separate sampling domain.

The first stage of sampling involved selecting sample points (clusters) from the sampling frames; the nonrefugee areas and the refugee settlements used separate sampling frames. Enumeration areas (EAs) delineated for the 2014 National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) were used as the sampling frame for the non-refugee areas.A sampling frame developed for the National Refugees’ Survey, conducted by UBOS in collaboration with the World Bank and Office of the Prime Minister in early 2018, was used as the frame for the refugee settlement domain. A total of 320 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the 2014 NPHC. Of these clusters, 84 were in urban areas and 236 in rural areas. Urban areas were oversampled within regions in order to produce robust estimates for that domain. A total of 22 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the refugee frame.

The second stage of sampling involved systematic selection of households. For the non-refugee areas, a household listing operation was undertaken in all of the selected EAs in November and December 2018, and households to be included in the survey were randomly selected from these lists. In the selected clusters for the refugee settlements domain, listing was undertaken immediately before fieldwork in those clusters. Twenty-eight households were selected from each EA, for a total sample size of 8,878 households. Because of the approximately equal sample sizes in each domain, the sample was not selfweighting at the national level.

Note: See Appendix A of the final survey report for additional details on the sampling procedures.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires—the Household Questionnaire, the Woman’s Questionnaire, and the Biomarker Questionnaire—were used for fieldwork in the 2018-19 UMIS. Core questionnaires available from the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) were adapted to reflect the population and health issues relevant to Uganda. The modifications were decided upon at a series of meetings with various stakeholders from the NMCD and other government ministries and agencies, nongovernmental organisations, and international donors. The questionnaires were in English; UBOS arranged for translation into Luganda, Luo, Lugbara, Ateso, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were programmed onto tablet computers, enabling use of computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) for the survey. The Biomarker Questionnaire was filled out on hard copy and entered into the CAPI system when complete.

A fourth questionnaire, the Fieldworker Questionnaire, was adapted from The DHS Program’s standard questionnaire. It was completed by all fieldworkers in the 2018-19 UMIS; its purpose was to collect basic background information on the people who collect data in the field.","A spreadsheet containing all sampling parameters and selection probabilities was constructed to facilitate the calculation of sampling weights. Household sampling weights and individual sampling weights were calculated by adjusting the previous calculated weight to compensate household nonresponse and individual nonresponse, respectively.

However, the recent refugee influx that doubled the number of refugees in the country in less than three years represents a challenge for the institutions, programs and mechanisms in place. The recent arrivals have put additional pressure on the public services delivery system, and to some central elements of the response approach, such as land availability for refugee use. The influx is also aggravated by the fact that refugee hosting areas were already vulnerable due to underlying poverty, limited resilience to shocks, limited capacity of local institutions, and low levels of human capital.

Moreover, it is representative of the refugee and host population in the regions of West Nile and South West, and the city of Kampala. The host population is defined as the native population in districts where refugee settlements are situated. The survey used two different sampling frames. The first one, based on the list of Enumeration Areas (EAs) and the information of the 2014 Uganda Population and Housing Census, was used to determine the samples for the host and refugee populations of Kampala, and the host populations in West Nile and Southwest. The second one is a newly developed sampling frame for the refugee population in the West Nile and Southwest regions.

Given the nature of the survey, the sample is stratified by three separate domains. The first domain is the host population in the regions of West Nile and South West. The second is the refugee population in the regions of West Nile and Southwest, and the third, the refugee and host population in Kampala. A total of 221 primary sample units were allocated to the three different domains. For each domain, the sample was obtained based on a two-stage stratified sample of households. In the first stage, PSUs were selected using a Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling method. For the host communities and Kampala, before the selection of the PSUs, district EAs were sorted by residence type (urban/rural), district sub-county, parish, village and EAs. For Kampala, only EAs that contained more than ten refugee households according to the 2014 Census were considered. With this sorting and PPS for the selection of PSUs, implicit stratification by residence type was achieved. For the refugee settlements, EAs were sorted based on the Settlement, Zone, Block, Cluster, Village, EA and by dominant country of origin. The latter was intended to ensure that PSUs with refugees coming from different countries of origin were selected.

Between the first and second stages, a household listing operation was carried out in all selected PSUs outside Kampala. For the listing operation, all selected PSUs were visited and the residential households were located with their address and the name of the household head was recorded. In the second stage, for each selected PSU, ten households were selected from the newly established list using a systematic sampling approach. Household selection was performed in the field prior to the main survey and interviewers only interviewed selected households. This means that no replacements or changes to selected households was allowed in the implementation stage in order to prevent bias.

No longer focusing exclusively on short-term, life-saving interventions, the response should act as a vector for refugees’ integration in the economy; improving management of land, water and natural resources; exploiting the socio-economic opportunities associated with the refugees’ presence, skills and development; and strengthening the hosting districts’ capacity to absorb and manage these resources.  The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration. 

In August 2017, FAO was asked by the Commissioner for Refugees (Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda, OPM) to support the implementation of a socio-economic analysis within the refugees’ settlements and host communities, with the aim of providing a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the refugees’ food security, well-being and resilience. Although refugees in Uganda are given land and mobility rights, their food security remains low, with a high dependency on food aid. The assumption was that by better understanding refugees’ preferences and livelihoods strategies which determine their resilience, it would be possible to unlock the development potential of the land, increase productivity and help them achieve independence and self-reliance.
