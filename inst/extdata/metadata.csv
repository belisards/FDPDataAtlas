To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), though we do not have information for all of the steps:

Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on characteristics of the household head (i.e. education, labor force status, demographic characteristics), characteristics of the household (consumption, assets, financial characteristics), and characteristics of the dwelling (house ownership, overcrowding). While the proGRES database is limited in the number of socio-economic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the proGRES database.
Additional technical details and explanations on each of the steps briefly outlined above can be found in Himelein, K.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

This ambitious and important research is initially focused on three countries in East Africa – Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.
 
In order to glean insights into the remittance process in the three designated countries, the World Bank designed a two-phase survey process. Phase 1 involved conducting a national survey in each of the three countries. The purpose of the first phase of research was to collect a large representative sample of the adult population in each country. The national surveys provide important baseline data about international remittance flows including: an estimate of the percent of the total adult population that regularly receives remittances, the average amount of each remittance received, most common methods of receipt and top sending countries. Additionally, through the analysis of the national survey results, World Bank was able to identify areas of each country that have high concentrations of international remittance recipients. This important piece of information guided Phase 2 of the research – surveys of remittance receivers in each country. Whereas the national surveys aimed to collect general data about the remittance process, the surveys of remittance recipients allowed for the collection of more detailed data about the remittance process itself, how remittances are used, the relationship between sender and receiver, and interest in various financial products.
 
The results of this research will not only provide estimates of total annual amounts of remittances for each country, but also will tell us the percentage of the population in each country that is involved in the international remittance process. Furthermore, it will offer insights as to the degree to which Ethiopians, Kenyans and Ugandans depend on international remittances and how the money is used, saved and/or invested. Results will also measure interest in financial products that, if utilized, can significantly impact the financial well-being of the population and the overall economic stability of each country.",Phase 1-2010-07-2010-08;Phase 2-2010-08-2010-0,"Households
Individuals",National Coverage,Sample survey data [ssd],NA,Bendixen & Amandi,"General:

The total samples were compiled utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling through respondent selection. Multi-stage random sampling ensured that a random sample of adults was collected in each country. First, after stratifying the population of each country by region and population density, sampling points (SPs) were determined. SPs were then randomly selected within each stratum. At each SP, respondents were randomly selected to participate in the survey.

Phase 1:

The first phase consisted of national surveys of the adult population of each country. The three survey samples were designed to be representative of the adult populations of these three countries. World Bank coordinated and oversaw all aspects of the sampling and interviewing process. A team of local field experts was hired in each country to conduct the actual interviews. All interviewers were professionally trained and supervised by research personnel. In this phase of the research, a total of 2042 Ethiopian adults were interviewed.

Phase 2:

Once the national surveys were completed, the results were analyzed to determine the areas of concentration of the remittance recipient population, after which the second phase of the project was conducted. This phase of the project included a targeted survey of the remittance recipient population of each of the three East African countries. Sampling Points were established based on the analysis of the national survey data and the identification of areas within each country that showed the highest concentrations of remittances received from relatives abroad in proportion to the sample size of all areas surveyed. Once again, local field experts were hired in each country to conduct the interviews, training and supervision of field operations. Languages of interviews were the same as those employed in Phase 1 and, again, all interviews were conducted in person using the PAPI method. A total of 400 interviews with regular international remittance recipients were completed in each country during August and September of 2010. The margin of error for all three surveys is approximately ±5 percentage points and the 95 percent level of confidence.

Detail:

The total sample was compiled utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling through respondent selection. This sampling method enabled B&A to ensure that a representative random sample of Ethiopian adults was collected. There are three stages to this type of sampling methodology. First, after stratifying the Ethiopian population by region and population density, sampling points (SPs) were determined. SPs were then randomly selected within each stratum. In the second stage, using the random route method, dwellings were selected within each SP. The random route method involves selecting an address in each SP at random as a starting point. Each interviewer was given instructions to identify additional dwellings by taking alternate left and right turns and stopping at every Nth dwelling. The third and final stage involved selecting actual participants - for each selected dwelling, individual respondents were chosen using a Kish grid. In a Kish grid, prior to beginning the interview, the interviewer first asks for the ages and genders of every household member (only persons aged 18 or older were eligible for selection). The individual to be
interviewed was then chosen based on a random number in the grid.

Once the national survey was completed, B&A analyzed the results to determine the areas of concentration of the remittance recipient population, after which the second phase of the project was conducted. This phase included a targeted survey of the remittance recipient population in Ethiopia. Sampling Points  were established based on B&A's analysis of the national survey data and the identification of areas of the country that showed concentrations of international remittance receivers in proportion to the sample size of all areas surveyed. Once again, local field experts were hired to conduct the interviews and B&A conducted all training and supervision of field operations. Interviews were conducted in Amharic and all interviews were conducted in person using the PAPI method. A total of 410 interviews with regular international remittance recipients were conducted in Ethiopia during August and September of 2010. The margin of error for the surveys is approximately ±5 percentage points and the 95 percent level of confidence.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Phase 1:

This survey consisted of 12 questions that were aimed at helping to identify some of the basic characteristics of the remittance recipient population in each country. Some of the variables included in this survey were – location, age, gender, amount of money received, method of receipt, origin of remittance, etc. 

Phase 2:

The survey instrument for Phase 2 consisted of approximately 35 questions and included a number of variables aimed at obtaining greater detail about the remittance receiving process including costs, amounts received, information about the sender and the relationship between sender and receiver. Additionally, the survey measured interest in various financial products.","As is the case with most surveys conducted in areas that have significant rural populations, there was some over-representation of people who reside in urban areas.

The sample consisted of four strata based on four regions: Tigray Afar (Eritrean refugees), Gambella (South Sudanese refugees), Benishangul Gumuz (Sudanese refugees), and Somali (Somali refugees). Each region hosts predominantly one refugee nationality leading to an implicit stratification based on nationality. In each stratum, camps were divided into Enumeration Areas (EAs) of equal size using GIS technology, and 82 EAs were selected per stratum. Within the stratum, the number of EAs per camp was selected proportional to the size of the camp. Within camps, EAs were selected with equal probability. Within each selected EA, all households were listed and then 12 were randomly selected for interview. 

The host community sample consisted of the same four regional strata. Within each stratum, areas within a 5km radius of a camp, were divided into EAs of equal size.

The questionnaire is available for download with the dataset.","The sampling weight is the inverse probability of selection. The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. For refugees, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum, multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households, and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA (usually 12) divided by the total number of households listed in the EA. Sampling weights for refugees were scaled to equal the number of households per strata as per the sampling frame provided by UNHCR. Due to changes in the sample during fieldwork, the number of EAs surveyed in each stratum differed from the original sample.
