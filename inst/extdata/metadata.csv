CBIs also directly complement community protection measures and support the local economy and can contribute to peaceful coexistence within and across communities. UNHCR Afghanistan has used cash-based interventions for several years for a wide range of purposes, including voluntary repatriation, basic needs, community-based protection, and livelihoods among others. UNHCR seeks to improve cash programming by regularly and systematically collecting information through post-distribution monitoring (PDM) on several aspects related to UNHCR’s CBIs including efficiency of cash delivery, access to markets, use of cash, unmet needs and coping strategies. Findings are expected to help UNHCR to improve the way the CBIs are designed and delivered.
This PDM covers two CBI programmes delivered by UNHCR in in the Eastern Region of Afghanistan in 2020, cash for protection and cash for shelter. Cash for protection was designed to support households with specific protection profiles to cope with the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 and avoid harmful coping strategies. Cash for shelter was designed to support vulnerable households with conditional cash grants to construct safe and dignified shelter. While the programmes were carried out countrywide, supporting 13,792 households with cash for protection and 506 with cash for shelter, the Eastern Region supported the largest number of CBI recipients. As such, this region was prioritized for the PDM data collection which took place in Kunar, Laghman, Nangarhar, and Nuristan provinces.

In these locations, large populations of refugee-returnees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities live together. Within these PARR locations, UNHCR implemented its short and medium-term Community-based Protection and Solutions Programme Response (CO-PROSPER) programmes to promote long-term development initiatives. UNHCR aimed to develop an area-based, humanitarian-development-peace triple nexus response to support durable solutions and create conducive conditions for the sustainable reintegration of displaced persons.
To understand the impact of these programmes on the PARR locations, IMPACT Initiatives (IMPACT) conducted an evaluation of the impact of the programmes in PARR locations across four different dimensions: 1) community leadership inclusivity, 2) strengthening public services and equitable access, 3) income generation and economic empowerment, and 4) peacebuilding, and created indices to measure progress over these four key objectives that can be compared against the programme goals. 
In order to conduct this assessment, a mixed-method approach was used with two structured tools with separate methodologies to assess each site as follows. 
A HH level tool was used to interview a representative sample of HHs in each of the 20 PARR locations, with a 95% confidence level and a 10% margin of error.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Relief International","The main focus of the survey was on the food security and vulnerability of resident populations in rural areas of Azerbaijan. Hence, the majority of household interviews were from these resident populations with only a small subsample of IDP households in the six economic zones. Separate samples were drawn by WFP VAM-HQ from each group for the survey.

A list of all communities and their populations in the economic zones of Guba-Kachmaz, Daglig-Shirvan, Sheki-Zagatala, Aran (divided into Kur and Orta-Kur), Ganja-Gazakh and Lankaran-Astara was provided by WFP Azerbaijan. Not covered were Nakhchivan an isolated zone surrounded by Turkey, Iran and Armenia, the occupied area of Nagorno-Karabakh and the occupied districts surrounding it, and the Absheron peninsula, which is sparsely populated except for the greater Baku area. Exceptions were the two districts Tartar and Khyzy -Tartar officially belonging to the occupied economic zone is covered under the Orta-Kur sub-sample and Khyzy, officially belonging to the Absheron peninsula, is covered under Guba-Kachmaz.

A two-stage cluster sampling was applied; the first stage was to draw a sample of 20, 30 or 40 clusters (in total 210 clusters) depending  on the population size of each zone or sub-zone. The second stage was to randomly select 12 to 15 households in each sampled community using interval sampling based upon the physical distribution of households within a grid. A total of 3,078 households were interviewed, which included 27 IDP-households that lived mixed with local residents. The sample allows comparisons between Economic Zones but is not precisely representative of the population.

The majority of IDP settlements are located in 13 districts. As it was difficult to obtain a reliable sampling frame indicating the location of IDP-settlements, it was decided to draw a purposive sample based upon the settlement type. Hence, the results are not statistically representative and should rather serve as estimates to describe in general the food security situation of IDPs in the country.

At the time of the survey only one railway camp still existed, the sample size is therefore rather small for this category. It should also be noted that many households categorized as dugouts, now live in small basic mud-brick houses located next to their former underground dwellings where they now keep livestock. It was still decided to treat these households as a separate category as they reside in a distinct geographic area; it can also be assumed that their former livelihoods as herders still determine many aspects of their current situation and livelihood opportunities.",Face-to-face,"The household questionnaire was developed to collect quantitative information on household demography, housing and amenities, household and animal assets, income sources & contribution, agriculture, expenditures; food consumption, food sufficiency, exposure to risks & shocks and coping strategies, maternal and child health and nutrition.

For maternal anthropometry, height and weight were measured for non-pregnant women while weight and length/height were measured on children less than 5 years of age. This information would be used to calculate nutritional indicators (stunting, wasting, underweight and BMI).

The sample for the Azerbaijan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was designed as a self-weighted sample to provide estimates of World Summit indicators at the national level and for urban and rural areas. The enumeration areas and the households from the Population Census of 1999 formed the sample frame. An enumeration area comprised about 507 persons on the average. It was thus possible to use enumeration areas directly as primary sampling units (PSUs) for first stage selection. The total sample size for the Azerbaijan MICS was calculated as 6112 households. The average cluster size was determined as 24 households and 254 clusters were selected. The sample was selected in two stages. At the first stage, the 254 clusters were distributed to three domains (the Baku area, other urban areas and rural areas) proportionately according to their size. The enumeration areas in each of the three domains were geographically sorted using the nine zones designated during the Soviet era but still in use in the country, albeit in a more limited fashion. Enumeration areas were selected with probability proportional to size, separately from the three domains. The household lists were updated in each selected enumeration area by using several computerized lists originating from the census, as well as the actual household questionnaires from the census, for the primary reason of including IDP/refugee households in the sample. During the second selection stage, households were systematically selected using a fixed sampling interval. A total of 6166 households were selected. The difference between the number of households selected and the target number of households is attributed to rounding during the selection procedures and the presence of multiple households in the selected households. Full technical details of the MICS sample are included in Appendix A of the final report.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaires for the Azerbaijan MICS were based on the MICS Model Questionnaire with some modifications, additions, and deletions.

The methodology that was chosen reflects the purpose of the survey. To balance a desire for a large, representative sample with the expense of a detailed survey instrument, a sample size of 2,016 households was selected. Three separate populations were covered: households in Baku, households outside of Baku and households of Displaced Persons. Within each of those populations, the sample was chosen in such a manner that each household had an equal probability of being selected. At the same time, the logistics of locating the households and conducting the interviews within a specific time frame required that the households be grouped into ""work loads"" of 12 households each. The size of the workload was determined by the number of interviews that could be carried out in one day by one team of three interviewers and a supervisor.

The Azerbaijan Survey of Living Conditions sample design included 408 households in the eleven raions that make up the city of Baku, 1200 households in the population outside of Baku, and 408 households among the registered Internally Displaced Persons residing throughout the country. This results in an oversampling of the Internally Displaced Persons population and an undersampling of the urban population of Baku. In order to use all data to provide nationally representative estimates, weighting factors must be applied to the data to account for the difference between the population and sample distributions. 

Outside of Baku

The most recent data on population came from the 1989 census, the most recent data on number of households was reported in 1994 by the National Statistical Committee. The country is divided into towns, villages of the town type, and villages. Every household is located in one of those three types of population points. A list prepared by the National Statistical Committee contains just over 4,250 of these population points.
To choose the sample outside of Baku, Baku was excluded from this list as were all the population points located in raions of the country currently occupied (Agdam, Xankendi, Xodjali, Xodjvendi, Susha, Kubatli, Zangelan, Kelbadjar, Lachin, Fizuli and Djebrali). The remainder of the country included 3453 population points.
Information on the number of households was not available for all population points, specifically, ""villages of the town type"" and cities did not have this information. Average household size was calculated for those points that had both population and the number of households and this number was used to impute the number of households for those population points where it was missing. Average household size was 4.25 which is smaller than expected but reflects the fact that numerator is a 1989 statistic and the denominator is from 1994.
First stage of sampling: Using the list of actual and estimated number of households for each population point, 100 workloads were spread across the population points in the following manner:
1. the sampling interval, i, was calculated to be the total number of households outside of Baku divided by 100,
2. the random start, s, was calculated by taking the integer portion of [random number * i + 1],
3. the population point containing the sth household, the (s+i)th household, the (s+2i)th household, etc. were then selected.
4. in the event that more than one interval landed on the same population point, multiple workloads of 12 households were surveyed in that population point. In this manner 100 workloads were distributed in 91 population points.
Second stage of sampling: In order to select the households within the selected population points, household lists maintained by the administrative office of each Selsoviet were used. Selsoviets are administrative units that cover from one to ten population points. In the population points covered by a single group of 12 households, 16 dwellings were selected--12 to be interviewed and 4 to be used as replacements if necessary. The sampling interval used was the total number of households on the list divided by 16. Each population point had been assigned a randomly generated number with which to calculate a starting point. In population points with more that one group of 12 households, 16 households were selected for each workload and the sampling interval was number of households divided by 16 multiplied by the number of workloads.
It is possible that a second household with separate finances could occupy a dwelling that was only listed once in the Selsoviet’s list. If an interviewer discovered more than one family living in a single dwelling, separate questionnaires were to be filled out for both, and a household randomly selected from among the households not yet interviewed on the list for that population point was taken off the list. This replacement of households, opposed to adding households, was adopted because the schedule did not allow time for more than 12 interviews per workload.

Baku

In February of 1995, SORGU was commissioned to do a random sampling survey in Baku. At that time a list was compiled of 2000 households in Baku. The 2000 households were distributed across the 11 raions of Baku according to each raion’s proportion of the total population. In each raion, the passport office lists were consulted to select the required number of addresses. In each office, the depth of each drawer full of cards was measured, the total length was divided by the number of households to be selected from that raion and cards were then pulled out at those intervals. From each card a specific address in Baku was noted. There is one passport for each dwelling in that raion regardless of the number of separate household/family units occupied the dwelling. The passport lists are, in principle, continuously updated with information from the housing maintenance offices. However, dwellings that are used for business, unoccupied, abandoned or rented to foreigners may remain listed. Furthermore, it is not clear how new privately built housing units would be listed.The 408 households and 92 replacements for this survey were selected by choosing a random number between 1 and 4, starting with that number and then selecting every fifth address from the existing list.

Internally Displaced Population

The National Statistical Committee prepared a listing of population and number of households of internally displaced persons by raion in July 1995. From that list, 34 workloads of 12 households each were selected from 26 raions and 11 Baku Administrative Regions using with a sampling interval and a random start similar to the method used outside of Baku. Ten workloads were selected in Baku and 24 were selected in 17 raions. As before, some raions received more than one workload. In each raion, the administrative offices for the Ministry of Refugees was consulted to locate the internally displaced persons. Each office should have a list of internally displaced persons by households. An additional level of sampling took place to choose three places and four interviews will be conducted in each place. These places were buildings, towns, or tent camps depending on how the households were listed.

Sampling as Implemented

In the course of the field work, it was discovered that population lists are not maintained in major urban areas. In Kuba, Xachmas, Devichi, Qaxi, Sheki, Ali Bairamli, Gojai and Agdash, supervisors had to improvise. In some cases passport registration lists were used, as was done in Baku. In other cases electric users lists, gas office books and butter/meat coupon distribution lists were used in order to capture a sample that was as representative as possible. During field work, one population point, Xandar, was not accessible due to security concerns and its proximity to the occupied region. A second population point, Sofukent, was not accessible because of the weather. In both cases, it was not practicable to replace the population points with two other population points randomly selected from the national list. Instead, field teams were instructed to visit the nearest population point of approximately the same size to the chosen population point. The only major disruption to fieldwork occurred in Naxicevan where interviewers were shot at by terrorists, fortunately none was hurt.",Face-to-face,"DEVELOPMENT OF QUESTIONNAIRES

A questionnaire based on the Living Standards Measurement Study surveys was adapted for use in Azerbaijan. Significant reductions in the number of questions reflected the need to conduct the survey in a short period of time and the more limited scope of a poverty assessment as compared to a full-blown government policy analysis. Questionnaire development was done using the Russian language version. The finalized versions were translated into Azeri by SORGU personnel. A special version of the questionnaire with both Russian and English was prepared for use by data analysts.

DESCRIPTION OF QUESTIONNAIRES

The survey includes questionnaires at both the household and population point (community) levels. Population point is an administrative designation that can be a village, a ""village of the town type"" or a town. All households in the country belong to one population point. First stage sampling was based on population points and second stage sampling was based on the household lists in selected population points. The population point served as the community in the ASLC.

Both questionnaires reflect the content and methodology used in many LSMS surveys. The household questionnaire, was abridged significantly to conform to the time frame and purpose of the survey. LSMS surveys are often designed to facilitate the analysis of the impact of a broad range of government policies on households. The Poverty Assessment required an assessment of economic well-being of each household and several broad measures of employment, education, health, housing and other areas of household activity. The scope of questions asked in the ASLC was much narrower than for a standard LSMS especially in the field of economic activities. It covers all of the topics covered in most LSMS surveys but contains far fewer questions, and therefore, less detail. The household questionnaire collects information at the individual and household level on all aspects of life and activity. The population point questionnaire gathers information common to all households in the sampling unit, thus limiting the length of the household questionnaire. Information collected for the population point includes the type and quality of social services available, predominant economic activities, the distance to regional and national centers, and a price survey.

Household Questionnaire

The household questionnaire contains nine modules: demographic information, housing, education, health, economic activities, migration, consumption and expenditure, household property and agriculture. The entire questionnaire was administered to the head of the household. Interviews were generally carried out in the main room of the dwelling with other household members present. The household head was invited to consult with other household members but other household members were not interviewed separately. Interviewers were instructed to collect information for all people who usually reside in the dwelling, eat together and share expenses and anyone who was in the dwelling the night before the interview.

Section 1, DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, collects the age, sex, relation to household head, marital status of all individuals, and the ID codes of the mother, father, and spouse if any of them are members of the same household so that children and parents can be linked. Section 1B gathers information on the sharing of expenses, length and reason of absence during the last 12 months. This information allows the researcher to vary, somewhat, the definition of household.

Section 2, DWELLING, gathers information on the size and type of dwelling, expenditures on rent or mortgage and utilities, source of water, heating, lighting and telephone for the household. These variables both reflect and have an impact on the health and welfare of the household members.

Section 3, EDUCATION, gathers information for all individuals 5 years and older on years of schooling and highest degree obtained. For household members who continue to study, information is collected on meals provided at school and reasons for absences of more than four weeks from school.

Section 4, HEALTH, collects, for each individual, information on health during the last 4 weeks, person from whom care was received, place where care was administered, and whether or not preventative care was received.

Section 5A, EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME, is completed for all household members 7 years and older. Information on sector, position and renumeration for primary and additional work was collected. Part 5B gathers information on search for work, and other economic activities. Part 5C gathers information on additional sources of income for the household including the sale of food products, gifts, pensions and state allowances.

Section 6, MIGRATION, gathers information for all individuals 7 years and older on years lived at current residence, previous place of residence, reason for movement to current place, official residential status, and type of work done in previous place of residence. For households that include internally displaced persons (IDPs), Section 6B gathers information on the degree of contact with people from the place of origin and assistance currently received. 
Section 6C gathers information on the property that these displaced persons had before the displacement, that which they were able to bring with them and that which they lost. Section 6B and 6C represent a substantial departure from standard LSMS survey questionnaires.

Section 7, CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURES, gathers expenditures in the last month for 17 categories of expenditure in Section 7A and the amount spent, value of home production consumed, and value received as gifts for 20 categories of food products in Section 7B.

Section 8, LIST OF DURABLE GOODS, gathers information on durable goods currently owned by the household including year of acquisition and goods sold within the last 12 months by the household.

Section 9, AGRICULTURE, covers land ownership and agricultural activities, expenditures and revenues in Section 9A and the number and total value of agricultural assets including animals, vehicles and equipment in Section 9B.

Population Point Questionnaire

One population point questionnaire was completed for each sampling point. Interviewers were instructed to interview as many community leaders as necessary in order to complete the questionnaire.

Section 1, DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, asks for information on population, ethnic composition, and migration.

Section 2, INFRASTRUCTURE, collects information on roads, electricity, water, sewer, and garbage collection in the community. There are also questions on the time and expense of a trip to the capital and regional center and on telephones, TV and newspapers in the community.

Section 3, ECONOMY, collects information on major economic activities, unemployment, the closing of state enterprises and the degree of independent economic activity.

Section 4, DISPLACED PERSONS, gathers information on the presence and living conditions of Internally Displaced Persons.

Section 5, EDUCATION, collects information on the proportion of girls and boys in school and the reason for non-attendance, the condition of the schools and whether there have been improvements or deterioration in the last 5 years.

Section 6, HEALTH, collects information on health problems of adults, children, and the effectiveness of health services, the place where women most often give birth, the existence of immunization campaigns in the last five years and the availability of drugs.

Section 7, AGRICULTURE, collects information on crops, agricultural activity, conditions and prevailing wage rates in the sector.

Section 8, INSTITUTIONS, collects information on the institutions in the community and for those that do not exist in the community, the distance and time required to reach the nearest one.

Finally, for each sampling point, three observations are made on the prices of 33 common food and household items.","The three samples of households: outside Baku (PPID 100-199), Baku (PPID 1-34), and IDPs (PPID 201-234) are self-weighted for those three groups of households.(PPID is the variable name for population point identification code.) However, the number of households selected from each group do not correspond to the percent of the three groups in the national population.

To use all sample households to represent all households in Azerbaijan, weighting factors should be used. This weight is included as variable W in the PP data

Most of these impacts are related to the direct health effect, but also to the containment measures that systematically altered socio-economic activities, resulting in a reduction of income across the board. Due to the urgent need for timely data and the limits on face-to-face surveys, the World Bank and the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD) decided to implement a high-frequency phone survey of national households (HFPS) (https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3768) to monitor the effects of COVID-19 on households, leveraging the available household phone number in the 2018/19 Enquete Harmonisée sur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages (EHCVM). 
In Burkina Faso, the forcibly displaced persons (FDP) include both refugees and internal displaced population. For security related issues, FDPs are predominantly internal displaced people (IDPs). According to recent studies, the number of internally displaced people soared from 87,000 in January 2019 to over 1 million in August 2020, an increase of more than 1000 per cent (Conseil National de Secours d'Urgence et de Réhabilitation – CONASUR, 2020). The unprecedented levels of displacement occurred as the coronavirus pandemic worsens an already critical humanitarian crisis in the violence-stricken country. This critical situation calls for the need of timely data and analysis especially during a pandemic for this vulnerable group in order to better inform policy and targeting programs. Given the mutual interest of the INSD, WB-UNHCR Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement (JDC), UNHCR, and World Bank, decision was made to further expand the sample of the high-frequency phone survey of national households (HFPS) to include IDPs for a total of three consecutive rounds. 
The core survey questionnaire of the Burkina Faso High Frequency Phone Survey on IDPs (BFA HFPS-IDP) is designed to cover important and relevant topics like employment, access to basic services and items, and non-labor sources of income. The core questionnaire is complemented by questions on selected topics that rotate each month, including knowledge of Covid-19 spread, social distancing and behavior, coping mechanisms to shocks, fragility, conflict and violence. Selected topics may be investigated more in detail in specific rounds.

The BFA HFPS-IDP is fielded alongside the Burkina Faso Covid-19 High Frequency Phone Survey of national households.

The CONASUR has been developed and supported by the government of Burkina Faso with the technical and financial support of development partners, including UNHCR, IOM and OCHA. The CONASUR database is updated regularly, and has exhaustive list of refugees and IDPs, along with few socio-demographic characteristics, as well as information on the phone numbers of households. The sample is drawn from the 9 regions (out of 12) where the presence of IDPs is more relevant: Boucle du Mouhoun, Cascades, Centre-Est, Centre-Nord, Est, Hauts-Bassins, Nord, Plateau Central, Sahel. It is important to note that the BFA HFPS-IDPs is representative of households that have access to phones. Taken that into consideration, a key concern is the bias introduced by sampling households with at least a phone number, as phone penetration in some regions/areas might be limited. However, according to data from the CONASUR database, the percentage of households with at least one phone number is very high, accounting for above the 74% in all the sampled regions.

To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), which outlines eight steps, of which we follow six, to construct the sampling weights for the BFA-HFPS:
1. Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on household characteristics as well as the characteristics of the dwelling. While the CONASUR database is limited in the number of socioeconomic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the CONASUR database.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

It is a representative survey of the post-2017 population of displaced Rohingya and households in host communities in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh.

The high-frequency phone tracking (HFT) surveys were built to maintain communication with baseline respondents while collecting rapid data on key welfare indicators on labor, basic needs and education. Three rounds of the HFT have been completed between 2020-2021, which have been used to produce welfare updates on the host and Rohingya population residing in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, particularly amidst the COVID-19 crisis.

The tracking surveys collected information across three broad welfare dimensions: labor, access to basic needs and education status of school-aged children. Round 1 collected information on labor and access to basic needs only; the module on education was added Round 2 onwards.",2020-04-2020-05; 2020-10-2020-12; 2021-04-2021-0,Households and individuals,Cox's Bazar district and some parts of Bandarban district.,Sample survey data [ssd],"The CBPS High Frequency Phone Tracking Surveys collected follow-up information on key household and individual welfare indicators, broadly across three dimensions: labor, access to basic needs and education status of school-aged children. The surveys collect standard indicators across both Rohingya and host populations. However, it should be noted that camps operate under different policy regulations compared to hosts, and as such, indicators and findings, for all three dimensions, are not directly comparable. 

Labor: The baseline survey administered the labor module on 2-3 randomly selected adults in the household. For the tracking survey, any one of the 2-3 adults who had completed the baseline survey were interviewed in a given tracking round. Weights were re-adjusted in each of the tracking rounds to ensure comparability with baseline population characteristics.

Access to basic needs: The basic needs modules across the rounds have collected information on a variety of topics ranging from a household's ability to have purchased basic food items, difficulties faced in obtaining said items, access to health services, consumption patterns and credit seeking behavior. All data collected is at household level.

Education: The education module was introduced in R2 and has collected information on educational engagement of school-aged children (all 3-18 years old at baseline 2019) amidst COVID-19. Note that the modules ask about any engagement in educational activities and not about school enrolment in context of COVID-19 school closures, thus comparisons with baseline figures should be approached carefully.

Note that Round 1 collected information on labor and access to basic needs only; the module on education was added Round 2 onwards. 

Please refer to the published briefs for details on how the indicators and findings should be inferred. Briefs are available here: https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bangladesh/brief/cox-s-bazar-panel-survey-briefs",NA,"The CBPS study has a total sample size of 5,020 households (HHs), divided among three strata covering Rohingya refugees in camps and host communities in Cox’s Bazar district and some adjacent regions of Bandarban district. The CBPS HFT attempted to follow the full baseline sample of 5,020 household in each round, with no alterations or additions made to the sampling design. The baseline sampling strategy is detailed below. 
The three strata are defined as:  
i. Rohingya refugees in camps 
ii. High exposure hosts: hosts within 15 km (3-hour walking distance) of camps
iii. Low exposure hosts: hosts at more than 15 km (3-hour walking distance) from camps
(In the datasets, the 'settlement_type' and 'stratum' variables identify the different levels at which the sample is representative)

Defining the camp strata: A two-step data collection on Rohingya refugee prevalence within host communities (i.e., outside of camps) confirmed that prevalence in host communities was low, and that this was the case not only for newer Rohingya displaced, but for the older cohort of displaced, as well. This pattern of refugee prevalence supported having one stratum for the Rohingya displaced living in camps. The sampling strategy for the CBPS therefore focused on generating representative estimates for the camp based Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar district.

Defining the host strata: For hosts, the sampling strategy was designed to account for the differential implications of a camp-based concentration of close to a million Rohingya displaced for different areas of Cox’s Bazar. To distinguish between host communities that are differentially affected by the arrival of the Rohingya, the CBPS sampling strategy used a threshold of three hours’ walking time from a campsite to define two survey strata: (i) host communities with potentially high exposure (HE) to the displaced Rohingya, and (ii) host communities with potentially low exposure (LE).

Sampling frame: The camp sample uses the Needs and Population Monitoring Round 12 (NPM12) data from the International Organization for Migration as the sampling frame. For the host sample, a combination of the 2011 population census, Admin 4 shapefiles from the Bureau of Statistics and publicly available Google Earth imagery and OpenStreetMaps were used to develop a sampling frame.

Stages of sample selection: For camps, NPM12 divided all camps into 1,954 majhee blocks.1 200 blocks were randomly selected using a probability proportional to the size of the camp. A full listing was carried out in each selected camp block.

For hosts, a two-stage sampling strategy was followed. The first stage of selection was done at the mauza level by strata. A random sample of 66 mauzas was drawn from a frame of 286 mauzas using probability proportional to size. Based on census population size, each mauza was divided into segments of roughly 100-150 households. The second stage selected three segments from each selected mauza with equal probability of selection.

Listing and replacements: Within each selected PSU in camps (blocks) and hosts (mauza-segments), all households (100-150 on average) were listed. Of listed households, 13 households were selected at random for interview, with an additional replacement list of 5 households. 
More information on the sampling strategy and process can be found on the published working paper titled “Data Triangulation Strategies to Design a Representative Household Survey of Hosts and Rohingya Displaced in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh”.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The R1 tracking questionnaire was developed as a lean version of the questionnaire implemented during the CBPS baseline. The R2 and R3 questionnaires retained certain aspects of the R1 questionnaire, but also added more detailed questions on aspects such as food security (in consultation with UN-WFP) and credit-seeking and coping behavior based on findings observed in previous rounds and dynamic research needs within the COVID-19 crisis.

One questionnaire was developed per round of data collection with modules containing household level questions on access to basic needs, credit-seeking behavior, access to health services, vaccinations and individual level questions on labor market status. Any adult, knowledgeable member of the confirmed sample household were eligible to answer the household modules. The labor module was only permitted if the respondent reached was any one of the 2-3 selected adults within the household who had completed the baseline adult questionnaires.

Questionnaires were developed in English and translated into Bengali. The translations to Bengali were thoroughly reviewed by the World Bank team’s local consultants to ensure quality. Pretesting and piloting were done using the Bengali questionnaires.

All questionnaires and modules in English are provided as external resources.","There are three types of weights in the CBPS baseline datasets. In what follows, the “level” of a dataset refers to what each observation in the data set represents i.e. a household, an individual, an occupation of an individual, etc. In general, the appropriate weight to be used is based on the unit of sampling: i.e. HH weights should be used for data collected at the level of the household (i.e. the household survey); and AA weights should be used for data collected at the level of individual adults i.e. the adult survey).

The two types of baseline weights – household weight and adult weight – have been readjusted for each tracking round based on the response rate. The respective tracking round weights are available on each dataset. Labor datasets contain aa_weight_r# and the basic needs datasets contain hh_weight_r#. The education datasets do not contain weights variable as individual roster member weights were not created during the baseline. It is expected that education outcomes will be analyzed at the household level using the hh_weight_r# weights.","Krishnan, Nandini; Khan, Afsana; Haque, Arshia; Tillan, Pablo; Endara, Joaquin, 2020, Cox's Bazar Panel Survey High Frequency Phone Tracking Surveys Rounds 1,2,3 (CBPS HFT'20-21), [URL], World Bank, V1","The user of the data acknowledges that the original collector of the data, the authorized distributor of the data, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.",NA,NA,Others,0,0,0,NA,90.24842878246852,23.844949865639045,South Asia,Bangladesh,Lower middle income,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

Teams across Asia interviewed a total of 2,846 Rohingya refugees in the six Rohingya-hosting countries in the region: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, and Thailand, which together host one million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. These consultations built on extensive work done by various stakeholders in recent years — particularly since the refugee influx to Bangladesh in 2016 and 2017 — to survey Rohingya refugees and ensure their voices are represented and reflected.

The information obtained through the survey was then enhanced and supplemented by information gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KII), which allowed for more nuanced and elaborated discussions and enabled UNHCR to capture the views of population groups (including children, youth, older refugees, persons with disabilities, female heads of households, LGBTIQ+ refugees, and parents of school-age children) whose voices are often under-represented.

UNHCR surveyed a representative sample of women and men and a range of age groups (15 to 17, 18 to 59, and 60 and over) among Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, and Thailand. The sampling methodology and sample sizes chosen ensured a low margin of error (7.5%) and provided a high degree of confidence (90%) that the results obtained from the portion of the population interviewed are representative of the views of the whole. This methodology also allows for statistically confident comparisons of the concerns and intentions of Rohingya refugees across different genders, ages, profiles, and countries of asylum. 

Due to their distinct profiles, experiences, and living situations, separate sample strata were drawn for two population groups in Bangladesh (Rohingya who arrived in the 1990s and those who have arrived since 2016) and in Indonesia (Rohingya living independently and those living in IOMsponsored accommodation).",Telephone interview,NA,NA,UNHCR (2022).

Most of the newly-arrived refugees have settled in hilly, formerly-forested areas that are vulnerable to landslides and flash-flooding in monsoon season and rely heavily on humanitarian assistance to cover their basic needs. As the crisis moves beyond the initial emergency phase, comprehensive information on the needs and vulnerabilities of affected populations is needed in order to inform the design and implementation of effective inter-sectoral programming.

Half of the refugees (55%) are children. Within two months of the first arrivals, the number of refugee population in Cox’s Bazar district quadrupled, which made it the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. The refugees continued to arrive by foot and boat in subsequent months. Most of them came with few belongings or cash. UNHCR was among the first humanitarian organisations to respond to the refugee influx with life-saving assistance. Packages of blankets, plastic sheets, sleeping mats, family tents, plastic rolls, kitchen sets, jerry cans and buckets were distributed initially to 250,000 refugees within weeks after their arrival. By end of August 2018, UNHCR distributed 93,803 Core Relief Item (CRI) packages to newly arrived refugee families, each containing tarpaulins, kitchen set, blanket, jerry can, bucket, sleeping mat and solar lamp. At the same time, 90,524 families received Upgrade Shelter Kit (USK) consisting of mulli and borak bamboos, rope, plastic tarpaulins, sandbags and toolkits, to reinforce their shelters for the monsoon season.

Presently, there are limits on how self-sufficient refugees can be, as they have restricted freedom of movement beyond the areas where the settlements are and also have no right to work. In addition, there is insufficient land within their settlements to support subsistence farming. As a result, many refugees are unable to access cash independently to support themselves, and many struggle for the basic necessities not already covered by humanitarian assistance. All current assistance in the form of in-kind distributions and services are free of charge. This includes, for example, food, shelter materials, household items and health services. A number of cash-for-work schemes were designed to support and manage some of the basic services and works in the camps; however, to date, they have not created sufficient income opportunities for refugees or host communities. Likewise, our teams have confirmed that some humanitarian aid items are being sold at local markets. This shows refugees are adopting other, and potentially harmful, coping mechanisms to generate cash for their needs that are not, or not fully, covered by current humanitarian assistance. Negative coping strategies such as food borrowing, reduction in the number of meals and reduced consumption of preferred foods are witnessed across the entire Rohingya refugee population. Between April and May 2018, UNHCR piloted the delivery of unconditional and unrestricted Multipurpose Cash Grants (MPGs) to cover unmet basic needs. This extended to all residents of Camp 5 and Camp 6 in the Kutupalong refugee settlement and was equivalent to approximately half of the monthly Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) for a family of five.
After completing the delivery of the grants, UNHCR conducted a detailed Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey (320 households were interviewed). A Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey is a mechanism to collect and understand refugees’ feedback on the assistance provided by humanitarian agencies like UNHCR. PDMs are widely used by UNHCR and help to evaluate the effectiveness of the assistance provided directly by UNHCR or through its partners. A PDM is conducted independently from the distribution exercise itself, but closely following it in time. This PDM was intended to evaluate the adequacy of the cash grant provided as well as patterns in its use. It also sought to identify challenges and constraints experienced, and seek refugees’ feedback on any improvements required to implement similar assistance again in the future.
The PDM supports a hypothesis that the current basic in-kind assistance packages provided to refugees are not sufficient to meet all demonstrated needs, with the result that potentially harmful coping mechanisms like selling assistance are employed. The adoption of this cash programme by UNHCR, therefore, seeks to ensure that refugees can address their multiple needs in accordance with their household and personal priorities, including benefits such as greater access to a more diversified diet, better hygiene or shelter improvements.",2018-05-14-2018-05-2,Household.,Camp 5 and Camp 6 in the Kutupalong refugee settlement.,NA,"The scope includes:

The underlying target population was estimated to be 283,937 adults (over 18 years old), ‘new’ Rohingya (those who had arrived in Bangladesh after the events of 25 August 2017) and currently residing in refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district. This number was determined through simple calculations based on the most current data available from the UNHCR (15 March 2019) at the time of data collection preparation. The target sample was 1,300 new adult Rohingya. The data provided by the UNHCR allowed the researchers to establish the population and gender distribution for each refugee camp, and thus choose the number of respondents to include in the survey from each camp proportionately. Each subgroup within the target population received representation within the sample and no subpopulation was overrepresented in the results

Out of a total of 1,455 surveys conducted, 1,277 were deemed sufficient for further analysis. The sample of 1,277 respondents can be considered broadly representative of the total adult, new Rohingya population residing in the selected refugee camps across Cox’s Bazar district

The enumerators were given instructions to select respondents randomly in the chosen camps which was not always possible for several reasons. Hence, even though the sample can be considered representative of the population under study, the potential for selection bias cannot be excluded.

The enumerators, as Rohingya refugees themselves and fluent in Rohingya, could clarify questions posed by the respondents. However, the questions and the responses were translated from English to Rohingya and from Rohingya to English respectively by each enumerator on the spot. This might have resulted in misinterpretations and/or negatively influenced the accuracy of some responses.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Utilising an Area-Based Approach, REACH collected localised information on the situation of Venezuelan asylum seekers and migrants living in host communities and abrigos managed by humanitarian actors in city neighbourhoods across Boa Vista, Pacaraima and Manaus. The aim was to increase the understanding of humanitarian actors of the living conditions, primary needs, vulnerabilities and coping strategies of the asylum seekers and migrants. 
This study aims to provide a representative overview of the profiles of Venezuelan asylum seekers and migrants living in different geographic locations and shelter settings in Brazil, for the purpose of increasing the understanding of humanitarian actors as to the extent to which the living conditions, needs, and vulnerabilities of Venezuelan households vary between households living in abrigos and those living in host communities, across three cities that are relevant nodes in the Brazilian refugee response: Pacaraima, Boa Vista, and Manaus.  The findings indicate that challenges related to accessing services are relatively similar across different locations and shelter settings. The findings indicate that challenges related to accessing services are relatively similar across different locations and shelter settings. Of all services, Venezuelans seem to face the most challenges regarding access to education; findings suggest that a lack of required documents and a limited local capacity are constraining the enrolment of Venezuelan children into local schools. These two factors were also the most likely to pose barriers to accessing social services and healthcare facilities.

Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad are particularly affected. Since 2014, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Far North region of Cameroon has steadily increased due to attacks by armed groups, in particular Boko Haram and rival groups. The situation of IDPs is worrying for the authorities.

In 2019, new waves of conflict and violence, associated with flooding, triggered more internal displacement. As of October 2021, the Far North region had 341,535 IDPs and 124,310 returnees (IOM DTM Round 22). In order to ensure the protection of IDPs in the three departments most affected in the Far North (Mayo-Sava, Mayo-Tsanaga et Logone-Et-Chari), a need was expressed by the different actors in the region and the authorities for credible detailed statistics on the IDP households and individuals that could be used for planning purposes. In this light, UNHCR supported the authorities in undertaking an IDP pilot profiling exercise between July and September 2021 in Mayo-Tsanaga.

The profiling collected data on a number of topics that could be used to assess the needs of the IDP population and identify solutions, namely living conditions, food security, essential items and legal protection. The profiling was carried out by UNHCR and the Comité Mixte de Protection which composed mainly of public service agents in the department of Mayo-Tsanaga. The profiling covered 85,908 IDPs in 17,572 households in 201 sites and villages.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on characteristics of the household head (i.e. education, labor force status, demographic characteristics), characteristics of the household (consumption, assets, financial characteristics), and characteristics of the dwelling (house ownership, overcrowding). While the proGRES database is limited in the number of socio-economic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the proGRES database.

The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. For refugees, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum, multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households, and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA (usually 12) divided by the total number of households listed in the EA.

The main goal of this survey is to provide, in conjunction with the LHS, an Aceh-wide representative control group of adult males between the ages of 18-65 for the ex-combatant survey. Male respondents were sampled from two randomly sampled households in selected rural villages and eight randomly sampled households in urban villages. A representative sample of male respondents can be achieved by combining the SHS and the  male  sub-population  of  the  LHS. 

- Ex-TNA Questionnaire: An Aceh-wide representative sample of ex-combatants. Eligible respondents included anyone who fought with GAM-TNA, or was in the GAM-TNA command structure, for at least one month since 1998. A full list of ex-TNA was enumerated in each of the 754 villages and ex-TNA were sampled with a 6 in 10 probability.

- Village Head Questionnaire (VHS): A survey of village-head characteristics, as well as village-level characteristics in all sampled villages. 

- Household Rosters: In the LHS, SHS and Ex-TNA surveys, data was collected on every member of the respondent's 1998 and 2008 households. The roster includes demographic, welfare, recruitment and conflict data on all members in the household at those times.",NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Given the large number of people displaced within the country since 2014, the survey was designed to capture a representative sample of internally displaced persons. Furthermore, given the prevalence of Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan region, the survey also sampled refugee households in Kurdistan. A socioeconomic survey of camp residents was conducted by CSO and KRSO in 2017 so to avoid duplication of effort, the camp residents were excluded from the SWIFT survey. Informal ad-hoc settlements that have been constructed since the last update of sampling frame were included in the survey through household listing operation in the sampled enumeration areas. The survey was designed to cover all governorates, including areas in Nineveh deemed safe for field visits.

The sampling design followed a nested logic. All households in the sample responded to a short questionnaire. The short form collected information on the following core non-monetary indicators of well-being: household roster, education attainment, labor market variables, dwelling characteristics, access to basic services, asset ownership, transfers and assistance (public and private), incidence of shocks, and subjective well-being. A random subset of the sampled households also responded to the complete list of questions on household expenditure. The full sample was designed to be representative for each governorate. The expenditure sub-sample was representation at the regional level, where each region comprises three to five governorates.

Within each governorate, the out-of-camp sample was selected in two stages as following.  First, using the exhaustive list of Census Enumeration Areas as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), between 60 to 150 EAs in each governorate was selected using Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) criteria, with the number of households in each area as the measure of size.  Listing exercise was conducted in the selected areas to update the list of households. In the second stage, using households as secondary sampling units (SSUs), six households were selected in each cluster with equal probability from the post-listing sampling frame. The sample of households in the second stage was stratified by residence status. In selecting six households from a cluster, three each of IDP and non-IDP households were selected in the non-Kurdistan region. In the Kurdistan region, two each of IDP, non-IDP, and refugee households were selected. If an enumeration area in Kurdistan had fewer than two refugee or IDP households, the gap was filled by randomly selecting resident households from the same enumeration area. Likewise, if a PSU in the rest of Iraq had fewer than three IDP households, the shortfall was met by resident households to reach a total of 6 households per PSU.

Expenditure information was collected from a subsample of households from a subsample of enumeration areas. In Kurdistan, one household each of residents, IDPs, and refugees in a subset of clusters responded to the expenditure questions and in Rest of Iraq, one household each of residents and IDPs answered the expenditure questions.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],NA,NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The first difficulty was that, as of 2015, there was no recent or reliable sample frame, even for Lebanese households, as the last official population census was conducted in 1932. Typically, such a sample frame consists of the universe of enumeration areas in a country, with associated estimates of population. This meant that we had to construct our own sample frame by selecting a few Small Area Units (SAUs) and then conducting a full listing operation by visiting every household within the selected SAUs and collecting basic demographic and contact information. The second difficulty was that there was no available cartographic division of the country into geographic areas small enough to be the subject of a full listing operation, which could then serve as a sampling frame for the SAUs. Circonscription Foncières (CF) were the finest level of disaggregation available; CFs are generally too large to be listed as some have populations of over 100,000. Finally, there was no available sampling frame for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which meant that we had to depend on UNHCR data on registered Syrian refugees, combined with the estimates of Lebanese population at the CF level.

1.Provide statistically reliable data on the prevalence of disabilities as well as data on access to services disaggregated by disability.

2.Increase the understanding of the situation of Syrian refugees with disabilities and their households compared to their peers without disabilities in relation to access to services, including education.

3.Recommend inclusive actions to be prioritized by humanitarian actors.

Quantitative data was collected in Lebanon in December 2017 and in Jordan in between October 2017 and January 2018. In Lebanon, 2,495 refugees from 506 households were randomly sampled in urban settings in Bar Elias as well as Informal Tented Settlements (ITS) in Bar Elias and Arsal. In Jordan, 6,381 refugees were randomly sampled in 1,159 households in Azraq and Zaatari camps and Irbid. In light of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD), the study defined disability as interactions between personal and environmental factors. Disability was measured by the level of difficulties a person faces when performing basic activities (referred as “domains”) regardless of impairments, using the modified Washington Group’s Extended Set (WG-ES) (more precisely, Short Set Enhanced plus fatigue) and Child Functioning Module (CFM).",2017-10-01-2018-01-3,Households,"Jordan: Azraq, Zaatari and Irbid camps

The 2012 JPFHS sample was designed to produce reliable estimates of major survey variables for the country as a whole, urban and rural areas, each of the 12 governorates, and for the two special domains: the Badia areas and people living in refugee camps. To facilitate comparisons with previous surveys, the sample was also designed to produce estimates for the three regions (North, Central, and South). The grouping of the governorates into regions is as follows: the North consists of Irbid, Jarash, Ajloun, and Mafraq governorates; the Central region consists of Amman, Madaba, Balqa, and Zarqa governorates; and the South region consists of Karak, Tafiela, Ma'an, and Aqaba governorates.

The 2012 JPFHS sample was selected from the 2004 Jordan Population and Housing Census sampling frame. The frame excludes the population living in remote areas (most of whom are nomads), as well as those living in collective housing units such as hotels, hospitals, work camps, prisons, and the like. For the 2004 census, the country was subdivided into convenient area units called census blocks. For the purposes of the household surveys, the census blocks were regrouped to form a general statistical unit of moderate size (30 households or more), called a ""cluster"", which is widely used in surveys as a primary sampling unit (PSU).

Stratification was achieved by first separating each governorate into urban and rural areas and then, within each urban and rural area, by Badia areas, refugee camps, and other. A two-stage sampling procedure was employed. In the first stage, 806 clusters were selected with probability proportional to the cluster size, that is, the number of residential households counted in the 2004 census. A household listing operation was then carried out in all of the selected clusters, and the resulting lists of households served as the sampling frame for the selection of households in the second stage. In the second stage of selection, a fixed number of 20 households was selected in each cluster with an equal probability systematic selection. A subsample of two-thirds of the selected households was identified for anthropometry measurements.

Refer to Appendix A in the final report (Jordan Population and Family Health Survey 2012) for details of sampling weights calculation.",Face-to-face,"The 2012 JPFHS used two questionnaires, namely the Household Questionnaire and the Woman’s Questionnaire (see Appendix D). The Household Questionnaire was used to list all usual members of the sampled households, and visitors who slept in the household the night before the interview, and to obtain information on each household member’s age, sex, educational attainment, relationship to the head of the household, and marital status. In addition, questions were included on the socioeconomic characteristics of the household, such as source of water, sanitation facilities, and the availability of durable goods. Moreover, the questionnaire included questions about child discipline. The Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women who were eligible for the individual interview (ever-married women age 15-49 years). In addition, all women age 15-49 and children under age 5 living in the subsample of households were eligible for height and weight measurement and anemia testing.

The Woman’s Questionnaire was administered to ever-married women age 15-49 and collected information on the following topics:
• Respondent’s background characteristics
• Birth history
• Knowledge, attitudes, and practice of family planning and exposure to family planning messages
• Maternal health (antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care)
• Immunization and health of children under age 5
• Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices
• Marriage and husband’s background characteristics
• Fertility preferences
• Respondent’s employment
• Knowledge of AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
• Other health issues specific to women
• Early childhood development
• Domestic violence

In addition, information on births, pregnancies, and contraceptive use and discontinuation during the five years prior to the survey was collected using a monthly calendar.

The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS program. Additions and modifications to the model questionnaires were made in order to provide detailed information specific to Jordan. The questionnaires were then translated into Arabic.

Anthropometric data were collected during the 2012 JPFHS in a subsample of two-thirds of the selected households in each cluster. All women age 15-49 and children age 0-4 in these households were measured for height using Shorr height boards and for weight using electronic Seca scales. In addition, a drop of capillary blood was taken from these women and children in the field to measure their hemoglobin level using the HemoCue system.

What was particularly attractive about the latest census from the perspective of sampling was that it explicitly asked about the nationality of all residents. This would have allowed stratification of areas by density of Syrians. However, the original design could not be implemented because we could not access the new sample frame based on the 2015 Jordanian census. The design was then amended to include a representative sample of the Azraq and Za'atari camps (which account for the vast majority of Syrian refugees in camps in Jordan). This sample was complemented by purposive samples of the surrounding governorates, Mafraq and Zarqa, where the sample included areas physically proximate to the camp and other areas with a high number of Syrian refugees. In Amman Governorate, a purposive sample was drawn, combining a geographically distributed sample with a sample of areas with a high prevalence of Syrian refugees per the 2015 census, as indicated by the Jordanian Department of Statistics. Analytically, this implies the insights from Jordan will be limited to camp residents, neighboring areas of the camps, and Amman governorate. For this reason, Amman is left out of the rest of the discussion, where our focus is on relating the innovative approaches that we followed to obtain near-representative sample in absence of recent sampling frame.

Two principle methods were used to collect primary data: household questionnaire and documents review in a summative evaluation approach. 

The survey adopted a summative evaluation approach and a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods were used to obtain answers to the survey questions. The mixed approach was adopted for purposes of complementary, triangulation, and validation of responses. Primary data was collected with the use of household questionnaires, Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and review of existing literatures and reports. The inclusive criteria of the survey allowed the enumerators to collect data from household heads or any household member of age 18 years and above who consented to participate in the survey. Qualitative methods mainly KIIs were also adopted in order to gather an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of the various primary targets of the programme. These included households, members of WASH Committees, NRC staff and staff from the implementing partner agencies. Observation method was also used during the survey to assess WASH infrastructure and human habits. The infrastructure included; water points, sanitation and hygiene facilities. 

The stratified random sampling survey was carried out in in the 4 camps of Kakuma and the 3 villages of Kalobeyei. In Kakuma, all the 13 zones were included in the study for significant representation. The study population comprised all the households for the 192,352 refugees and asylum seekers registered in Kakuma camp (153,593) and Kalobeyei settlement (36,099) as per UNHCR population statistics of August 2019. The respondents were sampled household heads or family members aged 18 years and above. Although teachers who are patrons of school health clubs where institutional latrines had been done were targeted for interview, they were not reached due to school vacation.",2019-12-02-2019-12-0,Household,Kakuma & Kalobeyei,Sample survey data [ssd],"Water access

As a result of this sampling frame error and a high non-response rate (including recipients not present at their places of residence), despite the sample size having been initially adjusted for the non-response rate, the teams opted to replace them with available respondents found on the ground (convenience sampling). The decision was taken as replacing the respondents with the ones from the original sample was logistically unfeasible as enumerators were allocated to particular locations and would have risked exhausting the sample without reaching saturation, while further delay was unacceptable in the face of evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the risks that the disease might reach the camp thus halting the exercise.

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites, and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey was designed to address these shortcomings and support the settlement's development framework, as well as the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Two socio-economic questionnaires were administered - the Basic and the Extended Questionnaires. While all households received the Basic questionnaire, 18.5 percent among them were randomly sampled for the extended questionnaire.

For this survey, a stratified single-stage sample design was applied. The sample was implicitly stratified for the three villages in the settlement. For the Basic SEP, all households in the settlement are selected and the selection probability is 1. For the Extended SEP, a targeted sample size of 1500 households was required to obtain a 15 percent difference in the poverty rates of 2 groups in the sample at a confidence level of 95 percent and a power of 80 percent. To randomly select these households, a straight forward approach was used to select these households from registered proGres families before the exercise. Thus, households that received the extended SEP were randomly determined before the start of the survey using the tablet.

This dataset contains information from eight waves of the COVID-19 RRPS, which is part of a panel survey that targets refugee household and started in May 2020. The same households were interviewed every two months for five survey rounds, in the first year of data collection, and every four months thereafter, with interviews conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) techniques. The sample aims to be representative of the refugee and stateless population in Kenya. It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless. Waves 1-7 of this survey include information on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, transfers, health, and COVID-19 knowledge. Wave 8 focused on how households were exposed to shocks, in particular adverse weather shocks and the increase in the price of food and fuel, but also included parts of the previous modules on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, and subjective wellbeing.
The data is uploaded in three files. The first is the hh file, which contains household level information. The 'hhid', uniquely identifies all household.  The second is the adult level file, which contains data at the level of adult household members. Each adult in a household is uniquely identified by the 'adult_id'. The third file is the child level file, available only for waves 3-7, which contains information for every child in the household. Each child in a household is uniquely identified by the 'child_id'.
The duration of data collection and sample size for each completed wave was: 
Wave 1: May 14 to July 7, 2020; 1,328 refugee households 
Wave 2: July 16 to September 18, 2020; 1,699 refugee households

It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless, where sampling approaches differ across strata. For refugees in Kakuma and Kalobeyei, as well as for stateless people, recently conducted Socioeconomic Surveys (SES), were used as sampling frames. For the refugee population living in urban areas and the Dadaab camp, no such household survey data existed, and sampling frames were based on UNHCR's registration records (proGres), which include phone numbers. For Kakuma, Kalobeyei, Dadaab and urban refugees, a two-step sampling process was used. First, 1,000 individuals from each stratum were selected from the corresponding sampling frames. Each of these individuals received a text message to confirm that the registered phone was still active. In the second stage, implicitly stratifying by sex and age, the verified phone number lists were used to select the sample. Until wave 7 sampled households that were not reached in earlier waves were also contacted along with households that were interviewed before.  In wave 8 only households that had previously participated in the survey were contacted for interview. The “wave” variable represents in which wave the households were interviewed in.  For the stateless population, all the participants of the Shona socioeconomic survey (n=400) were included in the RRPS, because of limited sample size. The sampling frames for the refugee and Shona stateless communities are thus representative of households with active phone numbers registered with UNHCR.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],"The questionnaire included 12  sections

Section 12: Conclusion","Sampling weights for the refugee and stateless samples were tailored to the respective sampling strategies. Kakuma and Kalobeyei sub-samples have used the baseline weights from the respective SES underlying the sampling frame to adjust for any differences in the sampling probabilities. Then, propensity score weighting based on the full population covered in the SES household survey, have been used to account for differences in the probability of owning a phone number. The estimated propensity score reflects the household probability to have a phone number registered by UNHCR. To mitigate the effect of outlier estimates, the mean propensity score is computed for each decile. The baseline weights are then multiplied with the inverse of the propensity score deciles. For the refugees living in Dadaab camp and urban areas, a cell weighting approach has been used. Thereby, the sample is split into sub-groups (cells) based on the gender and age group of household head. The weights were then scaled such that they reflect the proportion of each cell in the UNHCR registration data of all refugees living in the respective location. In the group of stateless people registered with UNHCR, each household has the same weight assigned, as their full population is called in this survey. Lastly, to ensure sampling weights have the correct proportions across strata, they have been scaled to match population totals as provided by the up to date UNHCR registration data. Variable: weight
The data is also weekly representative for all waves except for wave 8. The variable weight_weekly should be used for weekly representative estimates.
Panel Weights 
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals: 
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1 
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples 
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups 
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile 
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac 
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2) 
6. Apply post-stratification in the same way as for cross-sectional weights (step 2) Variable: weight_panel_w1_2

Weighting: Cross-Sectional weights

For the KNBS and RDD samples, to make the sample nationally representative of the current population of households with mobile phone access, we create weights in two steps.

Step 1: Construct raw weights combining the two national samples: The current population consists of
(I) households that existed in 2015/16, and did not change phone numbers,
(II) households that existed in 2015/16, but changed phone number,
(III) households that did not exist in 2015/16.

Abstracting from differential attrition, the weights from the 2015/16 KIHBS CAPI pilot make the KIHBS sample representative of type (I) households. For RDD households, we ask whether they existed in 2015/16, when they had acquired their phone number, and where they lived in 2015/16, allowing us to classify them into type (I), (II) and (III) households and assign them to KIHBS strata. We adjust weights of each RDD household to be inversely proportional to the number of mobile phone numbers used by the household, and scale them relative to the average number of mobile phone numbers used in the KIHBS within each stratum. RDD therefore gives us a representative sample of type (II) and (III) households. We then combine RDD and KIHBS type (I) households by ex-post adding RDD households into the 2015/16 sampling frame and adjusting weights accordingly. Last, we combine our representative samples of type (I), type (II) and type (III), using the share of each type within each stratum from RDD (inversely weighted by number of mobile phone numbers). Variable: weight_raw

Step 2: Scale the weights to population proportions in each county and urban/rural stratum: We use post stratification to adjust for differential attrition and response rates across counties and rural/urban strata. We scale the raw weights from step 1 to reflect the population size in each county and rural/urban stratum as recorded in the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census conducted by the KNBS (2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census, Volume II: Distribution of Population by Administrative Units, December 2019, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-ii-distribution-of-population-by-administrative-units). Variable: weight

Panel Weights
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals:
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2)
6. Apply post-stratification in the same way as for cross-sectional weights (step 2) Variable: weight_panel_w1_2

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites (about 40% of the total refugees in Kenya), and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey replicates the preceding Kalobeyei SES (2018), designed to address these shortcomings and support the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The SES is designed to be representative of all households living in Kakuma, which are defined as groups of people who regularly cook and share meals together. The Kakuma SES covers 2,122 households across the four Kakuma subcamps.

Most refugees in Kenya live in camps located in the impoverished counties of Turkana (40 percent) and Garissa (44 percent), while 16 percent inhabit urban areas—mainly in Nairobi but also in Mombasa and Nakuru.
Refugees in Kenya are not systematically included in national surveys, creating a lack of comparable socioeconomic data on camp-based and urban refugees, and their hosts. As the third of a series of surveys focusing on closing this gap, this Socioeconomic Survey of Urban Refugees's aim is to understand the socioeconomic needs of urban refugees in Kenya, especially in the face of ongoing conflicts, environmental
hazards, and others shocks, as well as the recent government announcement to close Kenya’s refugee camps, which highlights the potential move of refugees from camps into urban settings
The SESs are representative of urban refugees and camp-based refugees in Turkana County. For the Kalobeyei 2018 and Urban 2020–21 SESs, households were randomly selected from the UNHCR registration database (proGres), while a complete list of dwellings,
obtained from UNHCR’s dwelling mapping exercise, was used to draw the sample for the Kakuma 2019 SES. The Kalobeyei SES and Kakuma SES were done via Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). Due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, the Urban SES

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the survey data was collected via telephone. Hence, the survey is representative of households with active phone numbers registered by UNHCR in urban Kenya – Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru.  A sample size of 2,500 was needed to ensure a margin of error of less than 5 percent at a confidence level of 95 percent for groups represented by at least 50 percent of the population. 
  The sample for the urban SES is designed to estimate socioeconomic indicators, such as food insecurity, for groups whose share represents at least 50 percent of the population. Considering the total urban refugee population as of August 2020 and the proportions of main countries of origin, as well as a 10 percent nonresponse rate, the target sample size is 2,500 households in total, with 1,250 in Nairobi, 700 in Nakuru, and 550 in Mombasa. A total of 2,438 households were reached: 1,300 in Nairobi, 409 in Nakuru, and 729 in Mombasa. 
  The units in ProGres list are UNHCR proGres families, which are different from households as defined in standard household surveys. Upon registration, UNHCR groups individuals into ‘proGres’ families which do not necessarily meet the criteria to be considered a household. A proGres family is usually comprised by no more than one household. In turn, a household can be integrated by one or more proGres families.
Households were selected as the unit of observation to ensure comparability with national household surveys. Households are a set of related or unrelated people (either sharing the same dwelling or not) who pool ration cards and regularly cook and eat together. As proGres families were sampled, the identification of households was done by an introductory section that confirms that each member of the selected proGres family is a member of the household and whether there are other members in the households that belong to other ProGres families. Thus, the introductory section documents the number of proGres families present in the household under observation.
Before selecting the survey strata, the team attempted to better understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phones. From the proGres data, phone penetration in urban areas is high (Nairobi and Mombasa: 93 percent, Nakuru: 95 percent). To understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phone, we looked at socio-economic outcomes for proGres family refugees with access to a phone number and those without",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],NA,"The sampling weights were constructed using the outline in Himelein (2014): i) as the first step, the base weight was computed, equal to 1 for all households.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted in the 4 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo, Ifo 2 and Hagadera) between 28 August and 23 September 2017 by nutrition partners (MSF-Switzerland, Islamic Relief Kenya, International Rescue Committee and Kenya Red Cross) with overall coordination by UNHCR supported by WFP.
 
After the increase in the prevalence of GAM observed in 2016 (10.2% weighted prevalence of GAM in all camps from 8.1% in 2015), the 2017 SENS indicated weigthed prevalence of GAM 9.7% which is close to what it was in 2016. The difference between the weighted prevalence of GAM in all the camps in 2016 and 2017 is not statistically significant. However, its to be mentioned that the prevalence of GAM in Dagahaley, Hagdera, and Ifo 2 camp is 8.3%, 8.6%, and 9.4% which is classified as POOR nutrition sitation, while in Ifo camp its 12.7% classified as SERIOUS nutrition sitaition as per the WHO classiciation of the public health significance. Overall, weighted anaemia prevalence showed a sharp increase among children aged 6-59 months to 60.7%, up from 49.7% in 2016. This is well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold) and requires attention. In all camps, anaemia was well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold). The children 6-23 age group had the highest prevalence of anaemia; however, the prevalence in the children 24-35 age group was also very concerning as it was above the critical threshold in all camps.",2017-08-28-2017-09-2,"Children 0-23 months

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps.

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted between 20 August and 8 September 2018 in the 3 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo and Hagadera) to assess the magnitude and severity of malnutrition, assess trends by comparison with previous years and support programmatic decisions.

The weighted prevalence of global acutemalnutrition, the most important indicator, was 8.0% overall, falling within the POOR category (5-9%). However, there was a marked improvement from 9.7% in 2017. Only Ifo camp was within the SERIOUS category (10-14%). The high prevalence of anaemia remains a major concern, as shown by the anaemia prevalence among children which remained above the 40% critical threshold, despite having decreased. Anaemia prevalence among non-pregnant women jumped to 48.9% overall, from 43.6% in 2017 and was above the 40% threshold for all camps. Some improvement was recorded in terms of infant and young chid feeding indicators, although there is still room for improvement. The access to safe drinking water also continued to be satisfactory, while gaps were still observed in terms of sanitation.

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The sample size for children, 6-59 months, was calculated using ENA for SMART software (9th, July 2015) according to UNHCR SENS guidelines (version 2 (2013). The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019. 

A two-stage cluster survey was conducted using the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry. Information on other indicators was collected and analysed using UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations (Version 2 2013) (see www.sens.unhcr.org). 

ENA for SMART selects the clusters (blocks), once done a team was sent to a block to label the households numerically with indelible pens. Population density varies across the blocks at Kakuma. If a block contained 100 households or less, all households in the block were marked. If a Block contained more than 100 households then the team walked around the block to identify a path that divided the block into approximately two halves. One portion of the block was selected randomly. In the selected segment of the block the team proceeded to number all households from the first to the last. If there was more than one household in a particular compound, this was indicated at the entrance of the compound (e.g. 2019 SENS HH1). The numbering and labelling was done two days prior to commencement of the survey. 

If there was more than one household in a particular compound, this was indicated at the entrance of the compound (e.g. HH1-HH6). The numbering and labelling was done three days prior to commencement of the survey.",Face-to-face interview: Mobile,"1) Children 6-59 months (SENS Modules 1-2): Anthropometric status, oedema, enrolment in selective feeding programmes and blanket feeding programmes (CSB++), immunisation (measles), vitamin A supplementation in last six months, de-worming, morbidity from diarrhoea in past two weeks, haemoglobin assessment.

In November 2017, the World Food Programme (WFP) joined the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in the delivery of multi-purpose cash (MPC) to assist the most economically vulnerable Syrian refugee households to meet their basic needs. 

This study aims to measure the short-term (12 months or less) and long-term (more than 12 months) causal impact of the $173.50 and $175 MPC assistance provided by WFP and UNHCR respectively, over and above the $27 per person per month assistance, as well as the impact of discontinuation from MPC on the well-being of Syrian refugees. This report presents the causal impact on multiple dimensions of well-being, namely household expenditures, food security, housing, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education, employment, health and decision-making. 

The key take-away messages from the study are: 
1. The impact of MPC materialised across most dimensions of well-being in the long-term, indicating the importance of households' access to a longer duration of MPC.
2. The benefits of MPC fade for many indicators within 4 to 10 months after discontinuation, and households' well-being returned to pre-assistance levels for most indicators, and dropped slightly below the pre-assistance baseline for others. 
3. The findings would suggest that there are benefits to instituting longer cash cycles and/or linking MPC to other services through a 'cash plus' approach to expand and extend the positive impact of cash on beneficiary households and ensure sustainable impact. 

A total of 11,457 households were visited and used in this analysis, which constitutes one of the largest samples among impact evaluations conducted in Lebanon to date.",2018-07-23-2019-09-0,Household and individual.,"Bekaa, North, and Mount Lebanon",Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

- Decision making",Economic Development Solutions,"A total of 11,457 households were visited and used in this analysis, which constitutes one of the largest samples among impact evaluations conducted in Lebanon to date. The impact evaluation used a quasi-experimental fuzzy regression discontinuity design, which enables estimation of the causal impact of MPC after different enrolment periods in the programme (rather than producing simple correlations). For this purpose, a multi-sectoral household survey was collected across three regions in Lebanon (Bekaa, North, and Mount Lebanon), where 85 per cent of Syrian refugees and 94 per cent of MPC beneficiaries live, over three waves of data collection held in July/ August 2018, February/March 2019, and July/August 2019. The multiple rounds of data collection allowed for the measurement of effects that materialise at different points in time and enabled the validation of the detected impact. Furthermore, collecting data in the summer and winter made it possible to account for seasonal variations, and accessing administrative data from UNHCR on other assistance programmes targeting the population of interest made it possible to append this information and distinguish between the effect of MPC and other programmes. WFP and UNHCR cash assistance beneficiaries are selected based on a proxy means testing formula that constructs a vulnerability score for each household based on a set of socio-demographic characteristics from the UNHCR database. This score predicts the per capita expenditure level of households and is used to rank them from most to least vulnerable. All households with a score below the SMEB are eligible for MPC. However, due to budgetary constraints, only about 29 per cent of eligible households currently receive the MPC package. WFP follows a bottom-up approach by including in the programme households starting from the lowest scores and moving up the scores until the allocated funding is fully disbursed. UNHCR employs a geographical bottomup targeting approach by including the most vulnerable households in each geographic region until it reaches the regions allocated proportion given its budget constraints. Accordingly, the point at which the funding is fully disbursed creates an artificial cut-off line. This creates a quasi-natural experiment where households on either side of the cut-off are plausibly similar along observable and unobservable characteristics. As a result, the argument is that the only difference is the receipt of MPC. Thus, any differences in outcomes between households are attributable to the amount of cash assistance received, which allows for measuring the causal impact of the MPC. Notably, because the annual recalibration of the targeting formula that determines a households eligibility for MPC occurred prior to the collection of wave 2 data, this uniquely positioned the study to measure the impact of discontinuation on affected household.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaire included the following sections: demographics, education, employment, health, food, housing, economic situation, accountability.",NA,"Please cite as follows:

MICS is capable of producing statistically sound, internationally comparable estimates of social indicators. The current round of MICS is focused on providing a monitoring tool for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the World Fit for Children (WFFC), as well as for other major international commitments, such as the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS and the Abuja targets for malaria. 

Survey Objectives 
The 2006 Palestinian Refugee Camps, Lebanon Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey has as its primary objectives: 
- To provide up-to-date information for assessing the situation of children and women in Generic 
- To furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward goals established in the Millennium Declaration, the goals of A World Fit For Children (WFFC), and other internationally agreed upon goals, as a basis for future action; 
- To contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Generic and to strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems. 

Survey Content 

MICS questionnaires are designed in a modular fashion that can be easily customized to the needs of a country. They consist of a household questionnaire, a questionnaire for women aged 15-49 and a questionnaire for children under the age of five (to be administered to the mother or caretaker). Other than a set of core modules, countries can select which modules they want to include in each questionnaire. 

Survey Implementation 

The surveys are typically carried out by government organizations, with the support and assistance of UNICEF and other partners. Technical assistance and training for the surveys is provided through a series of regional workshops, covering questionnaire content, sampling and survey implementation; data processing; data quality and data analysis; report writing and dissemination. 

Survey results 

Results from the surveys, including national reports, standard sets of tabulations and micro level datasets will all be made widely available after completion of the surveys. Results from the surveys will also be made available in DevInfo format. DevInfo v5.0 is a powerful database system which has been adapted from UNICEF's ChildInfo technology to specifically monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. MICS Results will also be available through UNICEF's web site dedicated to monitoring the situation of children and women at www.childinfo.org.

The first difficulty was that, as of 2015, there was no recent or reliable sample frame, even for Lebanese households, as the last official population census was conducted in 1932. Typically, such a sample frame consists of the universe of enumeration areas in a country, with associated estimates of population. This meant that we had to construct our own sample frame by selecting a few Small Area Units (SAUs) and then conducting a full listing operation by visiting every household within the selected SAUs and collecting basic demographic and contact information. The second difficulty was that there was no available cartographic division of the country into geographic areas small enough to be the subject of a full listing operation, which could then serve as a sampling frame for the SAUs. Circonscription Foncières (CF) were the finest level of disaggregation available; CFs are generally too large to be listed as some have populations of over 100,000. Finally, there was no available sampling frame for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which meant that we had to depend on UNHCR data on registered Syrian refugees, combined with the estimates of Lebanese population at the CF level.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Likewise, the sample was stratified by location and population groups based on country of origin helping to account for the different economic realities from one part of the country to another, as well as differences between nationalities. Following discussion with the UNHCR country team and regional bureau, three geographic regions were presented for consideration : a) Southern Mexico; b) Mexico City; and c) the Northern and Central Industrial Corridor. Additionally, partners expressed interest in the Venezuelan community as a separate group, primarily residing in Mexico City, Monterrey and Cancun. The population of the four groups represents 67% of the active registered refugees in Mexico. Out of the 35,140 refugee households in the four regions, 26,688 families have at least one phone number representing an overall high rate of phone penetration. Across regions of interest, Hondurans make up the single largest group of PoC in Southern Mexico (38%), and the Northern and Central Industrial Corridor (43%), whereas Venezuelans make up over half of the PoC population in Mexico City (52%). Based on the above, a sampling strategy based on four separate strata was proposed in order to adequately represent the regions and sub-groups of interest: 1.

It thus requested support from the UNHCR-WFP Targeting Hub to facilitate the inclusion of Malian refugees in the national social registry. Accordingly, the two UN agencies assisted Mauritania’s National Social Registry to conduct a socio-economic census to identify  the most vulnerable households to target for prioritized assistance. Around 14,000 households were interviewed.

The purpose of the census was to:
-	Collect socio-economic information on all refugees in Bassikounou to understand needs at household level
-	Categorize refugee households based on their degree of vulnerability to inform programmatic decisions and joint targeting approaches
-	Include all refugees in the national Social Registry

In Malaysia, UNHCR provided urgent cash assistance to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, which hit especially urban refugees hard.

In Malaysia, refugees live in a very challenging environment with limited rights to health, education and work.  As the Malaysian government does not provide refugees with any monetary support, refugees depend on low-income work to provide for their families and for themselves.  As there are approximately 150,000 refugees in Malaysia, the CBI program is targeted to the most vulnerable groups, with a household income below the national poverty line, women and girls at risk, children and adolescents at risk and persons with serious medical conditions. Assistance to refugees who have been detained and have not managed to earn sufficient funds during their sentence is also provided. 

UNHCR uses Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugees' feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilization and effectiveness of the assistance items they receive. The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided, and related services.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The sample had 6 strata with each state as a stratum. Each stratum was divided into grids of 150 by 150 meters using GIS technology defining the enumeration areas (EAs). The number of EAs to be selected from each stratum was obtained proportional to the IDP population sizes in each state. 
For the IDP sample, the EAs consisted of two types of IDP settlements, which were host community settings and camp settings. A total of 111 EAs across the 6 states were randomly selected proportional to size. Out of these, 77 EAs were host community type EAs and 48 were camp-like EAs.
For the host community sample of 1,500 households, EAs were restricted to the 77 host community type EAs that were selected based on IDPs population numbers, in the absence of residential population estimates at this level. The survey is representative for IDPs and host communities, defining host communities as the non-displaced population living in the EAs with displaced populations.

All the households in the selected EAs were first listed, and 12 IDP households and 12 (or multiples of it) host community households were randomly selected and surveyed per EA, to reach the designated sample size.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The questionnaire contains modules on Household Member Roster, Household Characteristics, Food Consumption, Non food consumption, Livestock, Durable Goods, Wellbeing and Opinions, and Displacement. The questionnaire is available for download with the dataset.","The sampling weight is the inverse probability of selection. The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. The first-stage probability of selection for the EA is the same for the IDP and host community households. It is equal to the IDP population of the EA divided by the total number of IDPs in the stratum multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For IDPs, the second-stage probability of selection is the number of selected IDP households per EA divided by the number of listed IDP households in the EA. For host community households, the second-stage selection probability is the number of host community households selected per EA divided by the number of listed host community households in the EA.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

UNCHR Pakistan has always been at the front line of dealing with the Afghan refugee crisis. In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and its far lasting financial impacts, UNHCR Pakistan has rolled out an Emergency Cash Assistance Program to help refugees meet their basic needs and to mitigate harsh socio-economic impacts in the time of crises and countrywide lockdowns. UNHCR implemented a one-off emergency cash assistance to vulnerable refugee and asylum seeker families to help meet their basic needs including food, rent, and access to essential supplies and services. This large-scale cash distribution required an independent third-party post distribution monitoring (PDM) to confirm whether the beneficiaries have received their entitled cash payment and also to clarify the mode of utilization of cash, whether it has been shared, spent, or saved.  

UNHCR uses Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugees' feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilization and effectiveness of the assistance items they receive. The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided, and related services. UNHCR increasingly uses Cash-Based Interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to forcibly displaced and stateless persons in line with UNHCR's core protection mandate. In order to ensure that the cash assistance provided meets the intended programme objectives and that desired outcomes are achieved, UNHCR conducts regular post-distribution and outcome monitoring with a sample or all of refugee recipients.",2020-11-04-2020-11-2,Households,"The majority of the respondents were from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, followed by Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab.",Sample survey data [ssd],"The household survey covers the following sections:

For the households that are finally selected, information is obtained from all the individuals.

The sampling frame for the blocks was constructed as follows: 
i)	The addresses of 58,067 Venezuelan people registered in the 2017 Population and Housing Census were identified. 
ii)	The addresses of 10,076 people were available registered in the registry of Venezuelans who applied for the Temporary Permit of Permanence from the National Superintendency of Migration of the Ministry of the Interior. 
iii)	The blocks containing the addresses of the aforementioned information sources were identified using the Geographic Information System. A global framework of 19,074 blocks was built. 

The concept of block used in the survey is a physical area delimited by streets, avenues, roads, canals, etc. easily identifiable and can contain one or more homes, parks, vacant lots, sports fields, etc. 

The original design of the sample included the construction of three strata based on the number of dwellings with a Venezuelan population found in each block of the sampling frame: 1 to 5, 6 to 10, greater than 10. On the other hand, the population of the city of Lima was divided into 4 zones with the following districts:

North Lima: Los Olivos, San Martn De Porres, Comas, Carabayllo, Independencia, Puente Piedra
East Lima: San Juan De Lurigancho, Ate, Santa Anita, El Agustino, San Luis, La Molina, Lurigancho
Downtown Lima: La Victoria, Lima, Santiago De Surco, Surquillo, San Miguel, Brea, Barranco, Rmac, Lince
Jesus Maria, Magdalena Del Mar, San Borja
South Lima: Chorrillos, San Juan De Miraflores, Villa El Salvador, Villa Mara Del Triunfo, Lurn, Pachacamac

The housing framework was built by means of an exhaustive registry of buildings and dwellings in each of the selected blocks, identifying those places, be they dwellings or establishments, that had a population from Venezuela. The concept of housing for the purposes of the survey included private and collective dwellings (hotels, hostels, lodgings, churches and shelters), where the Venezuelan population is found. This concept is different from the one used in the regular INEI household surveys, which only considers private households with a maximum of 5 households. The concept of the household used was: People, whether or not they are related, who share the main meals and attend to their vital needs in common. This concept is different from that used in the INEI household surveys, where the budget is considered.",Face-to-face,NA,NA,"Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica, Peru: Survey Directed to the Venezuelan Population Residing in the Country - 2018.",NA,56;26,"city, urban, municipality, area, municipal, infrastructure, service, population, development, local;land, property, housing, plot, area, owner, ownership, building, settlement, house",Others,0,0,0,NA,-74.4162283998936,-9.10913953488038,Latin America & Caribbean,Peru,Upper middle income,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The Palestinian Family Survey is a national household survey programme developed by PCBS based on international standard demographic health surveys as well as MICS surveys. The Palestinian Family Survey was conducted as part of the fourth global round of MICS surveys (MICS4).  The survey provides up to date information on the health, economic, and social situation of women and children; in addition to providing information on characteristics of the family in which each woman and child live as well as the main indicators about the categories of youth and elderly. This offers a study, analysis, and understanding of the actual indicators and their relationship with demographic, social, economic, and environmental variables. The survey also measures the major indicators which allows countries to monitor their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) besides measuring the level of fulfilling other internationally agreed upon commitments; in addition to enabling policy and decision makers, and intervention programs to evaluate the plans and programs, amend them, and locate the areas of intervention based on the results. The carry out of the survey also aims at updating the databases on women and children as well as building and enhancing the technical staff capabilities of carrying out surveys and analyzing data out of them. The Palestinian Family survey conducted in 2010 was led by a technical team from the Palestinians Central Bureau of Statistics, UNICEF, and UNFPA, and Ministry of Health.

The Palestinian Family Survey was conducted for a representative sample of the State of Palestine. The survey was designed as a multi- stage cluster covering all the State of Palestine including two geographic areas; The West Bank which included 11 governorates: (Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Nablus, Ramallah & Al-Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho & Al-Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron) and the Gaza Strip which include governorates (Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah, Deir El Balah and North Gaza). Of the 15,355 households selected in the sample, results showed that the number of occupied households were 14,817 of which 13,629 households were successfully interviewed during the survey, giving a response rate of 92 percent. There were 13,982 women in the 15-49 age group of which a total of 11,173 eligible women were successfully interviewed, achieving a response rate of 80 percent. In addition, 8,024 children were identified in the household questionnaire for whom a total of 7,900 mothers or child caretakers were interviewed.

Urban and rural areas and the refugee camps in each of the sixteen governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sampling frames used has been established in PCBS,and basically comprises the list of enumeration areas. (The enumeration area is a geographical area containing a number of buildings and housing units of about 120 housing units on average.)

The total frame consists of the following two parts:
1- West Bank and Gaza Sampling Frame: containing enumeration areas drawn up in 2007. In the West Bank: each enumeration area consists of a list of households with identification data to ascertain the address of individual households. In Gaza: each enumeration area contains a list of housing units with addresses to ascertain the address of individual households, plus identification data of the housing units.
2- Jerusalem Sampling Frame (J1): contains enumeration areas only, geographically divided with information about the total number of households in these areas. However, there is no detailed information about addresses inside enumeration areas and the size of the enumeration area can be ascertained without the ability to identify the addresses.

Both frames were used in the sample design and selection and therefore, the sample will differ from one frame to another. Also, the method of reaching the sample units by interviewers may differ.

In the survey, two variables were chosen to divide the population into strata, depending on the homogeneity of parts of the population.
Previous studies have shown that Palestinian households may be divided as follows:
1- Governorates: there are 16 governorates in the State of Palestine: 11 governorates in the West Bank and 5 in the Gaza Strip.
2- Locality Types: there are three types : urban, rural and refugee Camps.

After determining the sample size, which equals 15,355 households, we selected a probability sample - a multi-stage stratified cluster sample as follows:
1- First stage: selecting a sample of clusters (enumeration areas) using PPS without replacement method to obtain 644 enumeration areas from the total enumeration area frame.
2- Second stage: selecting 24 households from each selected enumeration area of the first stage and using the systematic sample method. When reaching households, all individuals were interviewed from the eligible groups i.e. women 15-54 years, elderly aged 60 years or above and children aged 0-4 years
3- Third stage: selecting one child of age group 2-14 years for part of the questionnaire and one young person from the 15-29 age group to answer the youth attachment in the questionnaireThe Kish table was used to select one child at random.
4- Also in the women's health section, the questionnaire was administered to a maximum of three randomly selected women aged 15-54 years irrespective of their marital status living in the households. In the case where 3 or less women aged 15-54 were listed in the HH all women were interviewed. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non-response cases. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non response cases.
5- The elderly age 60 years and above questionnaire was administered for all elderly persons within the household.
6- The Youth questionnaire was administered by randomly selecting a youth member from households with odd household numbers assigned at the enumeration area level. Within this sample female and male youth were alternatively selected.

The sample was allocated with proportionally using the design strata of the governorates and the locality type according to the proportion of the population in the 2007 Census.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Family Survey 2010 - Final Report"" pp.167-171.",Face-to-face,"The design of the survey complied with the standard specifications of health surveys previously implemented by PCBS. In addition, the survey included indicators of MICS4 to meet the needs of all partners.

Five sets of questionnaires were used in the survey, three are considered as main questionnaires and are based on MICS4 standard questionnaires,viz.: 1) a household questionnaire which was used to collect information on all de jure household members (usual residents), the household, and the dwelling; and a section on general health and knowledge of HIV and AIDS adminstered to three randomly selected women 15-54 years in each houehold, irrespective of marital status, 2) a women’s questionnaire administered in each household to all ever-married women aged 15-54 years (to allow for comparison with the previous survey, however, all the tables and analysis were undertaken for the women aged 15-49 only; 3) an under-5 questionnaire, administered to mothers or caretakers for all children under-5 years living in the household. The two additional country specific questionnaires were, 4) the youth aged 15-29 years old questionnaire; and 5) the elderly (60+ years old) questionnaire.

• Household Questionnaire: Covers demographic and educational characteristics, chronic disease, smoking, discipline of children (2-14 years), child labor (5-14 years), education of children (5-24 years) and housing characteristics.
• Women’s Health (15-54 years) Questionnaire: regardless of marital status, awareness about AIDS, anemia in women aged 15-49 years.
• Ever married women (15-54 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics of eligible women, reproduction, child mortality, maternal care, reproductive morbidity, family planning, and attitudes towards reproduction.
• Children under age of 5 Questionnaire: Covers children’s health, vaccination against childhood diseases, early childhood development, chronic disease, and anemia.

Supplementary Questionnaires
• Youth (15-29 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, awareness and perception of family planning, health status, awareness about sexually transmitted diseases and reproduction.
• Elderly (60 years and over) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, social relations, activities, time-use, health status, and use of mass media.

The main three questionnaires (household, women and children under-5) are based on the MICS4 model questionnaires. Using the Arabic version of the MICS4 statndard questionnaires, the questionnaires were customized to the local context and were piloted in February 2010. Based on the results of the pilot, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires.","Sampling weights are necessary to make the results of the sample are representative to the target population, and to adjust the bias resulting from differences between the sample characteristics and the reference population characteristics which mainly coming from the non-response and non-coverage of the frame.

The steps of calculation the design weight:
1- In the first stage: the weight of enumeration areas (PSUs) were calculated depending on the probability of each enumeration area((PPS) sample selection).
2- In the second stage: the weight of households were calculated in each enumeration area.
3- Design households weights resulted from product of weights of first stage and second stage.
4- Merging design households weights to the households file and to the household individuals file, each individual obtained the weight of his/her household weight ,and it is considered initial weight for individuals (all households members)

Adjustment of sample weights for non-response:
The weights of the households and individuals were adjusted to non-response cases, which are explained in the result of the interview, and we got the adjusted weights for non- response of the sample.
The adjustment factor for household non-response is equal to:
Fnr = sample of occupied households in stratum h /sample of interviewed households in stratum h
Similarly, the adjustment factor for non-response at the individual level (women and under-5 children) for each stratum is equal to:
Fnr = Eligible women (or under-5s) in stratum h /Completed women’s (or under-5’s) questionnaires in stratum h These factors were multiplied by the design weights to get the adjusted weights for non-response.

Weights Calibration (post-stratification):
This form of weighting adjustment compensates for differences between the achieved distribution for the sample for some characteristic and known population distribution for that characteristic (hlweight). The source of distributions are population counts from projections. Furthermore, the population in the control totals should match the population surveyed. For example, if a population was excluded from the survey due to age groups, the same population should be excluded from the projections. the post-stratification method of adjustment was used to compensate for non-coverage.

Standardization of weights:
Standardized weights obtained from dividing the weights of the sample unit by the average of the weights, so the weights were standardized in such way that the total weighted sample interviewed is equal to the total unweighted.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The aim of the WB program is to help targeted countries achieve better consumer protection in financial services. The WB initiative has targeted both public and private sector agencies, and has sponsored comprehensive research projects with the objective of finding the best solutions for each individual country/region. The survey focuses on financial services such as banking, insurance, microfinance in terms of credit, savings and payment systems, and was designed to identify the level of financial awareness and familiarity with financial services providers in the West Bank and Gaza. The survey also tried to identify appropriate methods for expanding consumer education and strengthening consumer rights in the West Bank and Gaza. 

It is expected that the survey will support the objectives outlined by the Word Bank's Financial Governance/Consumer Protection in Financial Services Program. A major objective of this survey is to provide regional data for the World Bank's multi-national database. Thus, the inherent strengths of this initiative is that it will allow regional stakeholders the opportunity to draw upon both local and international data. Local, international, small and large-scale strategies can then be formulated by comparing the diagnostic reviews of local data to that of other survey countries. By learning from the successes and failures of other survey countries, more effective mechanisms for the improvement of consumer protection and financial literacy in the West Bank and Gaza can be established.",2011-05-2011-0,"Household, individual",National,Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey focuses on consumer protection and was designed with the goal of contributing to the development of the financial markets and national development agenda of the West Bank and Gaza.

Sampling Frame 

The sampling frame included all geographical locations in which the target population resides. The sampling frame was used to select the sample of locations for the survey. It also included the type of localities (urban, rural and refugee camps) and population size in each location. This information was taken into consideration in designing the survey sample. 

The following table provides the distribution of Palestinian households by governorates according to data available on the Census of 2007:

Total 646,318

The frame was divided into strata depending on the homogeneity of the divided parts as follows:
A) Governorates: 16 in the West Bank and Gaza.
B) The type of locality: city, village and refugee camp.

Sample Design and Type

Three Stage Stratified Cluster Sample of 2022 persons (2022 households). The sample design was as follows:
1. Stage one: selection a sample of 60 representative localities covering all strata.
2. Stage two: selection a random sample of Palestinian households from each location selected in the first stage.
3. Stage three: random selection of one person from each household using Kish table within the age group of 18 years old and above. Half of the sample will be male and half is female respondents.

Sample Size
The sample size was 2022 persons from all Palestinian territories aged 18 years and above. Main regions covered by the sample are: the West Bank (excluding Ramallah), Ramallah and Gaza Strip. The sample was distributed as follows:

Region  / # of Households 

Ramallah and Al Bireh 350 
West Bank 1000 
Gaza Strip 672 
Total 2022 

The margin of error in the main key variables is approximately 2.5% on the entire sample size and it should be bigger in the detailed domains.

Sample Representation:

The researchers ensured that the sample is representative of the following during the field work:

1) Geographical representation: the sample distribution covers all governorates of the West Bank (including Jerusalem) and Gaza strip, thus provides a comprehensive geographical representation.
2) Economic Activity: in general, Ramallah and Al Bireh governorate is considered the economic and commercial center and thus was given a higher weight in the sample compared to the rest of the localities.
3) Economic Sectors: the sample covered different economical sectors such as employees of industrial, services and commercial sectors (usually in the main cities), workers in the agricultural sector (rural areas) and workers in the informal sector (mostly in Gaza).
4) Poverty levels: the sample covers poor localities as provided by statistics. In general, Gaza is considered poorer than the West Bank. Also, refugee camps and some localities particularly in North West Bank are considered poorer than the rest of localities and the above sample distribution provides coverage of such localities.
5) Age Groups: the sample covered all age groups above the age of 18. The reason behind selecting the starting age to be 18 is the fact that it is within this age that an individual is expected to become involved with financial transactions and thus will be dealing with financial services.
6) Gender: the sample was gender balanced; half of the respondents were males and half were females. This corresponds with the gender distribution of the Palestinian Territories.
7) Infrastructure: the sample covered central and remote localities to guarantee representation of poor versus good infrastructure and availability of services including financial services.",Face-to-face,"A standard questionnaire was previously developed by the World Bank and was adapted to the Palestinian context by Riyada Consulting.

Technical and financial support was provided by the Palestinian Government, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

The global MICS programme was developed by UNICEF in the 1990s as an international household survey programme to support countries in the collection of internationally comparable data on a wide range of indicators on the situation of children and women. MICS surveys measure key indicators that allow countries to generate data for use in policies and programmes, and to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed upon commitments.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey has as its primary objectives:
- To furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward goals established in the Millennium Declaration and other internationally agreed upon goals, as a basis for future action.
- To contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Palestine and to strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2014 was conducted for a representative sample of Palestine. The survey was designed as a multi- stage cluster sample covering the entire country including two geographic regions; The West Bank which includes 11 governorates: (Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Salfit, Nablus, Ramallah and Al Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho and Al Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron) and Gaza Strip which includes 5 governorates (Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah, Deir El Balah and North Gaza) and was stratified according to urban, rural and camp areas.

Of the 11,125 households selected in the sample, results showed that the number of occupied households were 10,568 of which 10,182 households were successfully interviewed during the survey, giving a response rate of 96 percent. There were 13,964 women in the 15-49 age group of which a total of 13,367 eligible women were successfully interviewed, achieving a response rate of 96 percent. In addition, the number of children was 7,919 child in the Household Questionnaire of which a total of 7,816 child were interviewed giving a response rate of 99 percent. The total households interviewed included 56,367 individual members who were listed. Of these, 28,542 were males and 27,825 were females with a sex ratio of 103 males per hundred females.

It is noted that the Palestinian population is a young one. The percentage of individuals in the age group 0-17 years was 46 percent, whereas the percentage of individuals in the age group 18 and above was 54 percent. According to economic and social dependency categories, 39 percent individuals were in the age group 0-14 years, 58 percent in the age group 15-64 years which is the age category of economically active individuals; and 3 percent in the age group 65 years and over. The average household size in Palestine in 2014 was about 5.5 persons. About 91 percent of households are headed by men and about 9 percent of households are headed by women.

Urban, rural and camps areas in each of the governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sample size for the Palestinian MICS was calculated as 11,125 households. For the calculation of the sample size, the key indicator used was stunting prevalence among children age 0-4 years.

The number of households selected per cluster for the Palestinian MICS was determined as 25 households, based on a number of considerations, including the design effect, the budget available, and the time that would be needed per team to complete one cluster. Dividing the total number of households by the number of sample households per cluster, we obtain a sample of 445 clusters.

The 2007 census frame was used for the selection of clusters. Census enumeration areas were defined as primary sampling units (PSUs), and were selected from each of the sampling strata by using systematic pps (probability proportional to size) sampling procedures, based on the number of households in each enumeration area from the 2007 Population and Housing Census frame. The first stage of sampling was thus completed by selecting the required number of enumeration areas from each of the sixteen governorates, separately for the urban, rural and camps strata.

Since the sampling frame (the 2007 census) was not up-to-date, a listing of households was conducted in all the sample enumeration areas (EAs) prior to the selection of households. For this purpose, listing teams were formed who visited all of the selected enumeration areas and listed all households in these enumeration areas. The listing was conducted in 416 enumeration areas; this excludes 29 sample EAs in Jerusalem within the barriers J1. A total of 266 EAs were updated in the West Bank area and 150 EAs in the Gaza Strip. A 5-day training took place during the first week of September in order to provide the fieldworkers with the skills needed for conducting the listing in the sample EAs for the Palestinian Multiple Indicator Survey 2014. The main listing field work was conducted during the period September - October, 2014.

Lists of households were prepared by the listing teams in the field for each enumeration area. The households were then sequentially numbered from 1 to n (the total number of households in each enumeration area) at the Central Statistical Office, where the selection of 25 households in each enumeration area was carried out using random systematic selection procedures.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014 - Final Report"" pp.203-207.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaires for the Generic MICS were structured questionnaires based on the MICS5 model questionnaire with some modifications and additions. Household questionnaires were administered in each household, which collected various information on household members including sex, age and relationship. The household questionnaire includes List of Household Members, Education, Child Discipline, Household Characteristics, Water and Sanitation and Salt Iodization.

In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women age 15-49 and children under age five. The questionnaire was administered to the mother or primary caretaker of the child.

The women's questionnaire includes Woman's Background, Fertility/Birth History, Desire for Last Birth, Maternal and Newborn Health, Post-natal Health Checks, Contraception, Unmet Need, Marriage and HIV/AIDS.

The children's questionnaire includes Child's Age, Birth Registration, Early Childhood Development, Breastfeeding and Dietary Intake, Immunization, Care of Illness and Anthropometry.

The questionnaires are based on the MICS5 model questionnaire. From the MICS5 model English version, the questionnaires were customised and translated into Arabic and were pre-tested in December, 2013 in 4 clusters, out of each cluster 25 households were selected for interview, 25 households in Al-Bireh city and 25 households in Ramallah city (Urban), 25 households in Abu-Qash village (rural) and 25 in Al-Jalazoun refugee camp (refugee camps). The clusters were covered Ramallah governorate in the central of the West Bank. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires. In addition to the administration of questionnaires, fieldwork teams tested the salt used for cooking in the households for iodine content, observed the place for handwashing, and measured the weights and heights of children age under 5 years.","The Palestinian MICS sample is not self-weighting. Essentially, by allocating equal numbers of households to each of the regions, different sampling fractions were used in each region since the sizes of the regions varied. For this reason sample weights were calculated and these were used in the subsequent analyses of the survey data.

The major component of the weight is the reciprocal of the sampling fraction employed in selecting the number of sample households in the particular sampling stratum and PSU.

A final component in the calculation of sample weights takes into account the level of nonresponse for the household and individual interviews. The adjustment for household nonresponse in each stratum is equal to: 1/RRh
where RRh is the response rate for the sample households in stratum h, defined as the proportion of the number of interviewed households in stratum h out of the number of selected households found to be occupied during the fieldwork in stratum h.

The non-response adjustment factors for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires were applied to the adjusted household weights. Numbers of eligible women and under-5 children were obtained from the roster of household members in the Household Questionnaire for households where interviews were completed.

The design weights for the households were calculated by multiplying the inverse of the probabilities of selection by the non-response adjustment factor for each enumeration area. These weights were then standardized (or normalized), one purpose of which is to make the weighted sum of the interviewed sample units equal to the total sample size at the national level. Normalization is achieved by dividing the full sample weights (adjusted for nonresponse) by the average of these weights across all households at the national level. This is performed by multiplying the sample weights by a constant factor equal to the unweighted number of households at the national level divided by the weighted total number of households (using the full sample weights adjusted for nonresponse). A similar standardization procedure was followed in obtaining normalized weights for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires. Adjusted (normalized) household weights varied between 0.226 and 2.316 in the 445 sample enumeration areas (clusters).

Sample weights were appended to all data sets and analyses were performed by weighting households, women, or under-5s with these sample weights.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

RIDHS collected the indicators on fertility, family planning and maternal and child health which the survey normally provides. In addition, RIDHS integrated a malaria module and tests for the prevalence of malaria and anemia among women and children, thus determining the prevalence of malaria and anemia for women and children at the national level.

The main objectives of the RIDHS were:
• At the national level, gather data to determine demographic rates, particularly fertility and infant and child mortality rates, and analyze the direct and indirect factors that determine fertility and child mortality rates and trends.
• Evaluate the level of knowledge and use of contraceptives among women and men.
• Gather data concerning family health: vaccinations; prevalence and treatment of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections (ARI), and fever in children under the age of five; antenatal care visits; and assistance during childbirth.
• Gather data concerning the prevention and treatment of malaria, particularly the possession and use of mosquito nets, and the prevention of malaria in pregnant women.
• Gather data concerning child feeding practices, including breastfeeding.
• Gather data concerning circumcision among men between the ages of 15 and 59.
• Collect blood samples in all of the households surveyed for anemia testing of women age 15-49, pregnant women and children under age five.

- HOUSEHOLD: this questionnaire was used to list usual members and visitors in selected households.In addition ,some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed such as sex, age, education and relationship to the head of household.The main objective of the household questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for individual interview.

- WOMEN: Women's questionnaire was used to collect information on women of productive age ( 15-49 years) and this includes: background characteristics, marital status,birth history,knowledge and use of family planning methods,fertility preferences,antenatal and deliver care,breastfeeding practices,vaccinations and childhood illness.

- MEN: The Men’s Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-59 years living in the selected households. The Men’s Questionnaire collected information similar to that of the Women’s Questionnaire, with the only difference being that it did not include birth history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition. In addition, the Men’s Questionnaire also collected information on circumcision.",National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda,"The sample for the RIDHS is a two-stage stratified area sample. Clusters are the primary sampling units and are constituted from enumeration areas (EA). The EA were defined in the 2002 General Population and Housing Census (RGPH) (SNR, 2005). 

These enumeration areas provided the master frame for the drawing of 250 clusters (187 rural and 63 urban), selected with a representative probability proportional to their size. Only 249 of these clusters were surveyed, because one cluster located in a refugee camp had to be eliminated from the sample. A strictly proportional sample allocation would have resulted in a very low number of urban households in certain provinces. It was therefore necessary to slightly oversample urban areas in order to survey a sufficient number of households to produce reliable estimates for urban areas. The second stage involved selecting a sample of households in these enumeration areas. In order to adequately guarantee the accuracy of the indicators, the total number drawn was limited to 30 households per cluster. Because of the nonproportional distribution of the sample among the different strata and the fact that the number of households was set for each cluster, weighting was used to ensure the validity of the sample at both national and provincial levels.

All women age 15-49 years who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed (7,528 women). In addition, a sample of men age 15-59 who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible for the survey (7,168 men). Finally, all women age 15-49 and all children under the age of five were eligible for the anemia and malaria diagnostic tests.

The sample for the 2007-08 RIDHS covered the population residing in ordinary households across the country. A national sample of 7,469 households (1,863 in urban areas and 5,606 in rural areas) was selected. The sample was first stratified to provide adequate representation from urban and rural areas as well as all the four provinces and the city of Kigali, the nation’s capital.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires were used in the 2007-08 RIDHS: the Household Questionnaire, the Women’s Questionnaire, and the Men’s Questionnaire. The content of these questionnaires was based on model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS project.

Initial technical meetings that were held beginning in September 2007 allowed a wide range of government agencies as well as local and international organizations to contribute to the development of the questionnaires. Based on these discussions, the DHS model questionnaires were modified to reflect the needs of users and relevant issues in population, family planning, anemia, malaria and other health concerns in Rwanda. The questionnaires were then translated from French into Kinyarwanda. These questionnaires were finalized in December 2007 before the training of male and female interviewers.

The Household Questionnaire was used to list all of the usual members and visitors in the selected households. In addition, some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household’s dwelling unit such as the main source of drinking water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, the main energy source used for cooking and ownership of various durable goods. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women and children eligible for the hemoglobin (anemia) and malaria diagnostic tests.

The Women’s Questionnaire was used to collect information on women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and covered questions on the following topics:
• Background characteristics
• Marital status
• Birth history
• Knowledge and use of family planning methods
• Fertility preferences
• Antenatal and delivery care
• Breastfeeding practices
• Vaccinations and childhood illnesses

The Men’s Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-59 years living in the selected households. The Men’s Questionnaire collected information similar to that of the Women’s Questionnaire, with the only difference being that it did not include birth history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition. In addition, the Men’s Questionnaire also collected information on circumcision.",Weighting was used to ensure the validity of the sample at both national and provincial levels.,"""National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, Rwanda Interim Demographic and Health Survey 2007-2008 (RIDHS 2008), v01, provided by the National Data Archive. http://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/13""",The NISR provides these data to external users without any warranty or responsibility implied.NISR accepts no responsability and/or implication of any action resulting from the use of these data.,46;51;8;31,"child, nutrition, year, food, health, age, intervention, mother, disability, month;training, staff, consultant, program, activity, month, development, management, workshop, study;woman, gender, man, female, male, girl, youth, child, family, work;total, population, age, birth, year, fertility, percentage, people, net, growth",Food insecurity,0,0,0,NA,29.919673460725495,-1.9923076601582916,Sub-Saharan Africa,Rwanda,Low income,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No

Hence, relevant statistical parameters including a 95 percent confidence level and a margin of error of +-4 percent were applied to calculate the sample size. 

The sample size was calculated based on the total number of refugee groups (as the proxy to the total number of households) registered in UNHCR ProGres database as of November 2020. 

Systematic random sampling with a fixed periodic interval was conducted in each camps to select the households.
An alternative list of households was prepared before going to the field. The enumerators visited the households on this list if the interview with the originally sampled households could not be undertaken with justified reasons. 
At the household level, in principle, either the household head or spouse (in the absence of the head) or any adult member of the household (in the absence of both the household head and the spouse) were interviewed. Enumerator did not exclude the child-headed households if  sampled.

Against the background of ever-limited resources and recognizing that the refugee population is not homogeneously vulnerable, in mid-2021 WFP and UNHCR initiated the shift to the targeted provision of food assistance based on needs.
  A targeting strategy – developed by UNHCR and WFP with support from the Joint UNHCR-WFP Programme Excellence and Targeting Hub - was formulated with the following objectives:
- Identify vulnerable refugee households in need of humanitarian assistance and less vulnerable refugees with higher livelihood resilience who would benefit from livelihoods support;
- Ensure the greatest protection outcomes through strong community participation, communications with refugee communities and risk analysis to inform the approach.
  This second JPDM has served to ensure that the corporate practice of post-distribution monitoring is fulfilled. Additionally, it assessed the extent to which the targeting approach has – over a period of five months between May and September 2021 – achieved the above objectives.

  In addition, to better understand the vulnerability status of households receiving various assistance since the targeting started, the sampling of the 2nd JPDM was also designed to be representative at the assistance group level. Same as the first JPDM, the assessment team used the total number of ProGres Groups by the time the survey was designed (August 2021) as the most reliable proxy to the total number of households, hence the sample frame. The sample size was planned to reach (a minimum of) 2,400 households in total with 95% confidence level and 5% margin error while factoring a 15% non-response rate. The distribution of the households by camp and by eligibility group was proportional to the distribution of number of the total population in each stratification.

By sampling the households who were surveyed in the December’s 2020 JPDM and comparing their performances in key outcome indicators through a longitudinal analysis over a period of 5 months (May 2021 – September 2021). The assessment sheds light on the effectiveness of the targeting as other factors that may confound the interpretation of targeting impact such as refugees mobility, are controlled. 
  Among the sampled households of December 2020, those who remain registered/trackable in the camp and at the same time, have held the same eligibility group status since targeting started were sampled for the survey.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS:
- Dwellings: A building is an independent free-standing structure irrespective of its construction material, composed of one or more rooms.
- Households: A household consists of a person or a group of persons who live together in the same housing unit or part of it and who consider themselves as one unit in terms of the provision of food and/or other essentials of living for the group.  When most of the members of such a group are related by blood (i.e., biologically) the group shall be referred to as a Private Household for the purpose of the census.  On the other hand when the group (i.e., household as defined earlier) consists of members who are not related by blood and they are more than 10, they will be considered as Non-Institutional Collective Household.  Note that if the group consists of 10 or less members, it should be considered a private household.
- Group quarters: An institution is usually a set of premises used to house a large number of people who are not related by blood or marriage but bound together by a common objective or personal interest (e.g., universities, boarding houses, hospitals, army barracks, camps, prisons, hotels, etc.)",National,Census/enumeration data [cen],NA,NA,"MICRODATA SOURCE: Central Bureau of Statistics

The sampling followed a stratified multi-stage sampling approach in which villages were the primary sampling unit (PSU) and households were the secondary sampling unit (SSU), while stratification was done by target group. Accordingly, the first sampling stage consisted of selecting a sample of villages with probabilities that were proportional to size; villages with higher numbers of households had a higher probability of being selected for the survey. A random sample of households was then selected based on two approaches: systematic skips or systematic snowballing. This depended on the spatial distribution of the target groups in each
village. For example, in all camps and return villages where only IDPs reside, systematic skips were done. In villages with more target groups, systematic snowballing was performed for each target group.

Sampling limitations & specifications
- The sampling is designed to produce results representative for each target group in the locality. Analysis at the village level is not possible and therefore no reference to villages or breakdown by villages is done in the report.
- The locations targeted for the survey were not selected randomly across the localities and thus do not necessarily provide representative results of all settlement situations in the localities. The targeting of location has been based on a conflict sensitive approach and the programmatic scope of the PBF. However, the area level analysis has looked at locality as a whole and thus ounterbalance the survey scope which focused on the displaced target groups.",Face-to-face interview: Mobile,NA,NA,"PBF Sudan, DSWG Sudan, UNHCR, JIPS (2021).

The commitment is rooted in the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) from 2011, signed by the Government of Sudan, other major parties to the conflict and the international community, and which sets out the framework for peace in Darfur. The peace agreement and the Darfur Development Strategy (DDS) that followed constitute political commitments to support durable peace and development in Darfur. This pledge has resulted in piloting a durable solutions process in El Fasher in North Darfur.
To reach durable solutions and end displacement, long-term planning based on agreed and jointly-owned comprehensive data is needed. To establish an agreed evidence base, a collaborative profiling approach was adopted that brought actors together to ensure trust and ownership of the results of the profiling exercise. An important aspect of this durable solutions profiling is that it places IDPs centre-stage alongside the two other major stakeholdersthe Government of Sudan and the international communitypermitting the profiling results and recommendations to be owned and signed off by all parties. The durable solutions profiling exercise in El Fasher makes up step two: getting better informed about the displacement affected communities in the five-stage durable solutions process. The survey included 3002 households. It specifically aims to:  provide a comprehensive profile of IDPs residing in Abu Shouk and El Salaam IDP camps; develop a better understanding of IDPs vulnerabilities, coping mechanisms, capacities and provide insight into IDPs perceptions and their future settlement intentions; provide a jointly agreed upon data set to help inform durable solutions programming responses;  pilot a profiling exercise of displacement and joint durable solutions planning that could be replicated in other Sudan contexts with displaced populations.",2018-05-01-2018-07-3,Household and individual,Abu Shouk and El Salam IDP Camps,Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey includes the following topics:

The sample was divided into four strata: IDPs in Abu Shouk camp, IDPs in El Salam camp, non-displaced people living in peri-urban El Fasher and non-displaced inhabitants of urban El Fasher. The four strata were divided into clusters of similar population size, based on a grid developed on a map of the areas. Clusters were selected from each stratum with a uniform probability of selection. The sampling was conducted in this manner, because there was no reliable population data available which would have made sampling probabilities to size possible. All the households in the selected enumeration areas were listed, while 12 were selected for interviews in each cluster in simple random draws. The listing exercise resulted in a significantly lower number of clusters than was planned. To compensate for the lower number of clusters, some of the listed clusters were selected for oversampling. To draw the sample, the listing data was restricted to IDP households in IDP clusters and non-displaced households in the El Fasher clusters.

The sampling procedure had two steps. The sample was stratified according to the 18 pre-war regions—which are the country’s first-level administrative divisions—and population types. This resulted in 57 strata, of which 7 are IDP, 17 are nomadic, 16 are exclusively urban strata, 15 exclusively rural, and 2 are combined urban-rural strata. The sample size in some strata was too small, thus urban and rural areas were merged into one single strata; this was the case for Sool and Sanaag.

Round 1 of the COVID-19 SHFPS was implemented between June and July 2020. The survey interviewed 2,811 households (1,735 urban households, 611 rural households, 435 nomadic households, and 30 IDP households in settlements). The sample of 2,811 households was contacted using a random digit dialing protocol. The sampling frame was the SHFPS Round 1 data - the same households from Round 1 are tracked over time, allowing for the monitoring of the well-being of households in near-real time and enabling an evidence-based response to the COVID-19 crisis. 

Round 2 of the COVID-19 SHFPS was implemented in January 2021. A total of 1,756 households were surveyed (738 urban households, 647 rural households, 309 nomadic households, and 62 IDP households in settlements). Of the 1,756 households, 91 percent were successfully re-contacted from Round 1, with the remainder reached via random digit dialing.

Based on the sampling design, sampling weights were calculated after the completion of data collection. Sampling weights were calculated with two goals: i) to correct for the selection bias generated by the Random Digit Dialing (RDD) protocol, namely to correct for the under-coverage of households that do not have access to a mobile phone, and ii) to ensure representativeness of the distribution of Somali households by state and population type. The first is achieved using a Propensity Score Weighting (PSW) methodology. To this end, the probability of being included in the phone survey is estimated and observations with a lower probability of being included are given a higher weight. The second is achieved using a post-stratification methodology. The final weight combines a propensity score weight and a post-stratification weight.

In Round 2, cross-sectional weights (CSW) were calculated for all households interviewed in round 2.

The sample in the settlements was stratified by population group and was representative at the total population level. The distribution of each population group was proportionate to their size in each settlement and was considered when distributing the sample across the settlements. For the IDPs from South Central Somalia and refugees/asylum seekers, a non- probabilistic sampling approach was adopted due to the relatively small size of these population groups and scattered distribution in the urban area of Hargeisa. For the IDPs originating from south- central Somalia and residing in the urban areas of Hargeisa outside of the known settlements, the profiling deployed respondent- driven sampling, whereby the individuals being surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know.

Strata were defined along two dimensions - administrative location (pre-war regions and emerging states) and population type (urban areas, rural settlements, IDP settlements, and nomadic population). Households were clustered into enumeration areas (EAs), with 12 interviews was expected for each selected EA. Primary sampling units (PSUs) were generated using a variety of techniques depending on the population type. The primary sampling unit (PSU) in urban as well as rural strata was the enumeration area (EA). For IDP strata, primary sampling units were IDP settlements as defined by UNCHR’s Shelter Cluster. Across all strata, PSUs were selected using a systematic random sampling approach with selection probability proportional to size (PPS). In IDP strata, PPS sampling is applied at the IDP settlement level. In second- and final-stage sample selection, a microlisting approach was used, such that EAs were divided into 12 smaller enumeration blocks, which were selected with equal probability. Every block was selected as 12 interviews per EA were required. A similar second-stage sampling strategy was employed for IDP strata. Each IDP settlement was segmented manually into enumeration blocks. Finally, one household per block was interviewed in all selected blocks within the enumeration area.The household was selected randomly with equal probability in two stages, following the micro-listing protocol. The strategy for sampling nomadic households relied on lists of water points. The list of water points was divided up by stratum at the federated member state level and they served as primary sampling units. Water points were selected in the first stage with equal probability, with 12 interviews to be conducted at each selected water point. The selection of nomadic households to interview relied on a listing process at each water point whose aim was to compile an exhaustive list of all nomadic households at the water point.

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS:
- Dwellings: A building is an independent free-standing structure irrespective of its construction material, composed of one or more rooms.
- Households: A household consists of a person or a group of persons who live together in the same housing unit or part of it and who consider themselves as one unit in terms of the provision of food and/or other essentials of living for the group.  When most of the members of such a group are related by blood (i.e., biologically) the group shall be referred to as a Private Household for the purpose of the census.  On the other hand when the group (i.e., household as defined earlier) consists of members who are not related by blood and they are more than 10, they will be considered as Non-Institutional Collective Household.  Note that if the group consists of 10 or less members, it should be considered a private household.
- Group quarters: An institution is usually a set of premises used to house a large number of people who are not related by blood or marriage but bound together by a common objective or personal interest (e.g., universities, boarding houses, hospitals, army barracks, camps, prisons, hotels, etc.)",National,Census/enumeration data [cen],NA,NA,"MICRODATA SOURCE: Southern Sudan Centre for Census, Evaluation and Statistics

In Waves 1 and 2, the sampling strategy consisted of a stratified clustered design. Within each of the 7 strata (7 states, urban and rural) the primary sampling units are EAs that were drawn randomly proportional to size. Within EAs, a listing was conducted and 12 households were drawn randomly as unit of observation. 

The CRS was conducted in 4 IDP camps in South Sudan between May to July 2017. The sample was restricted to Protection of Civilian (PoC) camps, and includes the 4 largest camps with clearly defined boundaries. The sample was designed as a multi-stage stratified random sample. Each camp was selected as a strata, with a target of 600 interviews per camp. Within each camp, 50 enumeration areas (EAs) were selected proportional to size, where the size was defined by the number of structures in the EA. The number of structures was counted using satellite imagery of the EAs and strata. Each EA was divided into 12 blocks, and a micro listing was done in the blocks to randomly select households. One structure per block was selected, and one household per structure was interviewed.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The questionnaire comprises the following modules.

The questionnaire is available for download with the dataset.","The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA and the selection probability of the household within the EA. 

In the HFS, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum estimated using the 2008 census. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA over the number of listed households in the EA. Sampling weights were then scaled to equal the number of households per strata using the Census 2008 data. 

In the CRS, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of structures in the EA divided by the number of structures in the stratum multiplied by the number of EAs selected in the stratum. The number of structures was estimated using satellite imagery of the strata (camps). The selection probability of a household within the EA is decomposed into the selection probability of a block within the EA, the selection probability of a structure within a block, and the selection probability of a household within a structure. The sampling weights are then scaled to equal the number of structures per stratum as per the satellite imagery. In the Bor camp, the total number of households was similar to the target sample size, thus a census was conducted -- therefore, each household had a probability of selection of 1 and thus a sampling weight equal to 1.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Gorom Refugee camp is located 24 km from Juba city. It has an estimated refugee population of 23471 who are mainly of Ethiopian nationality. The Anyuak refugees from Ethiopia have been in Gorom settlement since 2011. UNHCR and ACROSS carried out the nutrition survey in Gorom refugee camp from 16 to 20 September 2019. The overall aim of this survey was to assess the general nutrition and health status of refugee population and formulate workable recommendations for appropriate nutritional and public health interventions. 

UNHCR population figures from ProGres were used to determine the total population and that of children 6-59 months for survey planning purposes. At the end of August 2019, the Gorom refugee population was 2347 individuals. 395 (16.8%) of these were children under five years. 
An exhaustive survey was conducted in relation to children as the total population size of Gorom camp was below 2,500 people rendering sampling unnecessary following UNHCR SENS guideline. All children aged 6-59 months in the camp were surveyed. 

A total of six survey teams composed of four members each (one team leader, one haemoglobin measurer, one anthropometric measurer/translator and one anthropometric/haemoglobin measurement assistant were included in each survey.

UNHCR in collaboration with AHA, IRC and WFP carried out the nutrition survey in Pamir and Ajoung Thok refugee camps from 21 to 31 October 2019. Pamir and Ajoung Thok are the official refugee camps in Pariang County, Unity State. No nutrition survey was carried out in Yida as comprehensive services were not provided in 2019 considering its exit strategy. Refugees from Yida continue to be relocated to Pamir and
Ajoung Thok refugee camps. The overall aim of the survey was to assess the nutrition situation among the refugee population and to monitor ongoing programme interventions. In each of the camps a cross- sectional survey was conducted using the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) version 2, 2013 guidelines (http://sens.unhcr.org/) and the Standardised Monitoring and Assessments of Relief and Transitions (SMART) guidelines (https://smartmethodology.org/). Systematic random sampling was used to identify the survey respondents.

The surveys had a total of 4 modules consisting of 3 individual level and 1 household level questionnaires following UNHCR SENS guidelines version 2, 2013. The modules included: 
1. Anthropometry and health targeting all children aged 6 to 59 months in all the sampled households; 
2. Anaemia targeting all children aged 6 to 59 months in all the sampled households and all non-pregnant women aged 15 to 49 years in every other sampled household, 
3. Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) targeting all children aged 0 to 23 months in all the sampled households; 
4. Food security targeting every other sampled household. 

The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and mosquito net coverage modules were not carried out. This is because there is a WASH monitoring system in place and WASH Knowledge Attitude and Practices (KAP) assessment was conducted within the same month as the nutrition survey. Information on mosquito net coverage was carried out within the year in Pamir and Ajoung Thok in a separate partner assessment. The Emergency Nutrition Assessment (ENA) software version July 9th, 2015 was used to calculate the sample sizes of children and households for participating in the survey.

A total of six survey teams composed of four members each (one team leader, one hemoglobin measurer, one anthropometric measurer/translator and one hemoglobin/anthropometric measurement assistant) were included in each survey. A standardized training lasting five days, which included a standardization test was provided.

method for each zone to ensure that each household has the same chance of being investigated within the camp, whether it is part of a large or small area.

The survey applied a full-coverage (census) approach, i.e. no sample selection was made. The registration database served as the list frame. The total number of completed interviews was 12,643 households (7,393 in Gozamir and 5,250 in Belom).

While the original data collection took a full-coverage approach, the public-release version of the dataset contains a systematically drawn sub-sample of this original data for reasons of statistical disclosure control. The total sample size in the dataset presented for public release is 2,528 households (1,478 in Gozamir and 1,050 in Belom).",Other [oth],"All questionaires are provided in section ""external ressources"".","This dataset is self-weighting.

Two surveys were conducted in Nyarugusu refugee camp to allow comparison among the old population predominantly from the Democratic Republic of Congo and the new arrivals mostly the Burundians and Congolese who arrived in the camp as from May 2015. 

The main objective of the 2016 nutrition survey was to determine the health and nutrition status among children 6-59 months living in the refugee camps. Additional indicators on child health such as immunization, vitamin A supplementation, incidence of diarrhoea in the past two weeks, infant and young child feeding practices (IYCF) and anaemia prevalence among children aged 6- 59 months and non -pregnant women aged 15 - 59 years, household food security, WASH, Mosquito net coverage and mortality were also assessed. 

The survey employed the Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology in accordance with the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey guidelines V2 2013. Multi-stage cluster sampling method was applied to select households in Nyarugusu and Mtendeli camps whereas simple random sampling was used in Nduta refugee camps.

Currently there are three refugee camps namely Nyarugusu (comprising of Old and New Camps) located in Kasulu, Nduta in Kibondo district and Mtendeli in Kakonko district. 
The oldest refugee camp is Nyarugusu which has been hosting refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi since 1996. Refugees from Burundi were repatriated voluntarily in 2012 leading to closure of some of the existing camps. The remainder population in need of protection were relocated to Nyarugusu camp where the total population then was about 65,000 as of early April 2015 majority being Congolese refugees and other minority nationalities such as Rwandese, Sudanese, Ugandans, and Kenyans. 

The refugee situation changed in 2015 following the political instability after the general elections in Burundi leading exodus of some Burundians to Tanzania and other neighbouring countries. As from late April 2015 higher numbers of refugees from Burundi started arriving in Tanzania mainly through a tiny border village along Lake Tanganyika and other entry points in Kigoma region. After the influx, the total population increased causing congestion in Nyarugusu camp calling for the re-opening two camps; Nduta camp on the 7th October 2015 and Mtendeli camp on 14th January 2016. 
Nyarugusu currently hosts Congolese refugees (Old Camp) and 39.4% of the Burundi refugees (New Camp) who arrived at the onset of the emergency. Nduta hosts an estimated population of 123,673 refugees who were relocated from Nyarugusu and Mtendeli hosts 52,004 who were relocated from Nyarugusu and is still receiving the new arrivals. According to UNHCR ProGres data August 2017, the total number of refugees in Kigoma Region is estimated to be 310,735. 

A total 4 surveys were conducted from 21st Aug to 18th Sept 2017 covering Nyarugusu Old Camp, Nyarugusu New Camp, Nduta and Mtendeli.

Despite facing its own economic challenges, for decades Tanzania has welcomed thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring countries of Great Lakes Region. The counties geographic proximity to the strife-torn Congo Basin is responsible in part for the ease access of displaced populations. As well Tanzania was an early signatory in the region to international agreements on the rights and welfare of refugee and asylum seekers.
 
As of December, 2018, Tanzania host some 284,300 camp-based refugees, 77% of who are children and woman, in Nduta, Nyarugusu and Mtendeli Refugee Camps in Kigoma region in Northwest Tanzania. About 74% are from Burundi, and the remaining 26% are primarily from Democratic republic of Congo. 

Following a Tripartite Commission meeting in August 2017, the governments of Tanzania, Burundi, and UNHCR agreed to assist refugees who wish to voluntarily repatriate from Tanzania to Burundi. A subsequent meeting in March 2018 reaffirmed the commitment of both governments and UNHCR to uphold the principle of voluntariness, and noted that while some refugees may opt to return, others will continue to be in need of international protection. The March 2018 Tripartite meeting also produced a work plan entailing the repatriation of approximately 2,000 refugees per week from 5 April to 31 December 2018. As from January to 30th September 2018, a total of 52,260 refugees were assisted to voluntarily repatriate to Burundi from Tanzania in 88 Convoys; bringing the total repatriated from September 2017 to 57,865 of which 57.2% are children.

Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.

Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).

Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. 
Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.

Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. 

Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin. Similarly, internal movement within Uganda and opportunities to migrate to a new country are areas in which refugees say they lack guidance from humanitarian agencies or other actors.",2019-10-08-2019-10-3,Individuals and households,"Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma)",Sample survey data [ssd],Admission and rights; emergency response and ongoing needs; resilience and self-reliance; expanded solutions; voluntary repatriation; demographics.,Ground Truth Solutions,"This survey is the third round of questions Ground Truth Solutions has asked in Uganda; the first round took place in 2017 and the second in 2018. As in previous rounds, respondents to the current round of questions have been selected randomly, but the respondents themselves are different from those in previous rounds. When designing the sampling strategy for this survey, we used the most recent figures for populations of refugees from the UNHCR refugee portal. Based on this data, we decided to focus on South Sudanese and Congolese refugees, as they made up 92% of all the refugees in Uganda at the time. Refugees from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia each made up 0-3% of the overall refugee population and were excluded from this study. This is not to say that the perspectives of more marginal groups are not important, but rather that gathering these perspectives was simply beyond the scope of our research in view of the geographical and time constraints involved. In terms of the locations selected, we decided to include Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja (and to exclude Kampala, Lobule, Oruchinga, and Palabek), as over 90% of South Sudanese and Congolese refugees reside in these refugee settlements, according to UNHCR's most recent figures. 

The actual sample size achieved was 1,511 participants from 10 refugee settlements across Uganda, and the sample size in each settlement was proportional to the population size of the targeted communities within any given settlement. Using a confidence level of 95%, this sample size affords an expected margin of error of 3%. 

Ground Truth Solutions co-led enumerator training and supervised data collection on the ground. Within each of the 10 selected settlements, we chose particular zones from which to collect data, and within these zones, we selected smaller village/cluster units. In selecting the zones, we grouped them into two or three tiers, depending on the population size within the given zones of the camp, and asked the data collection partner to select one zone from each tier in order to capture responses from differently sized areas. Within the zones, a GTS supervisor, in consultation with local leaders and actors on the ground, selected the villages/clusters based on several factors, such as when they were established, their distance from central points, and their population size.",Face-to-face,"Survey questions were developed to help understand refugees’ perceptions of the aid they receive, their relationship with humanitarian workers and the host community, and their future prospects.

We consulted local actors and organisations in Uganda for feedback and input during the survey question design phase. Draft questions were also presented to UNHCR, the Assessment Technical Working Group (ATWG), the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), and the Office of the Prime Minister.

Other Rhino Camp residents come from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sudan, as well as the host Ugandan community. 74% of all heads of household are women,4 and Rhino Camp is one of a growing number of refugee settlements across nine UNHCR operations where solar street lamps are in use. Between April and June 2015 UNHCR installed some three dozen community lights in 50% of Rhino Camp’s 14 villages. As demand for community lighting far exceeded available funds, UNHCR worked with the refugee community and its partner the Danish Refugee Council to prioritize the strategic placement of lights within villages. The partners jointly selected locations where (1) refugees were prone to nighttime violence, theft or other safety risks, and (2) lights would promote constructive night-time activity.

Using a 72-question survey, researchers asked respondents what day- and night-time6 activities they and their children do, and whether they do these activities in lit or unlit locations. Researchers then asked respondents if they feared or had been victims of something bad while doing these activities. The phrase something bad is the English translation for the most commonly used expressions – in Nuer, Dinka, Bari, and Kiswahili – of being a victim of an aggressive act or encountering danger.

The UDHS is the fourth com­prehensive survey conducted in Uganda as part of the worldwide Demographic and Health Sur­veys (DHS) project. The primary purpose of the UDHS is to furnish policymakers and planners with detailed information on fertility; family planning; infant, child, adult, and maternal mor­tality; maternal and child health; nutrition; and knowledge of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. In addition, in one in three households selected for the survey, women age 15-49, men age 15-54, and children under age 5 years were weighed and their height was measured. Women, men, and children age 6-59 months in this subset of households were tested for anaemia, and women and children were tested for vitamin A deficiency. The 2006 UDHS is the first DHS survey in Uganda to cover the entire country. 

The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) was designed to provide information on demographic, health, and family planning status and trends in the country. Specifically, the UDHS collected information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, and breastfeeding practices. In addition, data were collected on the nutritional status of mothers and young children; infant, child, adult, and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and levels of anaemia and vitamin A deficiency.  

The 2006 UDHS is a follow-up to the 1988-1989, 1995, and 2000-2001 UDHS surveys, which were also implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The specific objectives of the 2006 UDHS are as follows: 

- To collect data at the national level that will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly the fertility and infant mortality rates 
- To analyse the direct and indirect factors that determine the level and trends in fertility and mortality 
- To measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice of women and men by method, by urban-rural residence, and by region 
- To collect data on knowledge and attitudes of women and men about sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, and to evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use 
- To assess the nutritional status of children under age five and women by means of anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and to assess child feeding practices 
- To collect data on family health, including immunizations, prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea and other diseases among children under five, antenatal visits, assistance at delivery, and breastfeeding 
- To measure vitamin A deficiency in women and children, and to measure anaemia in women, men, and children 
- To measure key education indicators including school attendance ratios and primary school grade repetition and dropout rates 
- To collect information on the extent of disability 
- To collect information on the extent of gender-based violence. 

MAIN RESULTS

- Fertility : Survey results indicate that the total fertility rate (TFR) for the country is 6.7 births per woman. The TFR in urban areas is much lower than in the rural areas (4.4 and 7.1 children, re­spectively). Kampala, whose TFR is 3.7, has the lowest fertility. Fertility rates in Central 1, Central 2, and Southwest regions are also lower than the national level. Removing four districts from the 2006 data that were not covered in the 2000­2001 UDHS, the 2006 TFR is 6.5 births per woman, compared with 6.9 from the 2000-2001 UDHS. Education and wealth have a marked effect on fertility, with uneducated mothers hav­ing about three more children on average than women with at least some secondary education and women in the lowest wealth quintile having almost twice as many children as women in the highest wealth quintile. 

- Family planning : Overall, knowledge of family planning has remained consistently high in Uganda over the past five years, with 97 percent of all women and 98 percent of all men age 15-49 having heard of at least one method of contraception. Pills, injectables, and condoms are the most widely known modern methods among both women and men. 

- Maternal health : Ninety-four percent of women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a skilled health pro­fessional for their last birth. These results are comparable to the 2000-2001 UDHS. Only 47 percent of women make four or more antenatal care visits during their entire pregnancy, an im­provement from 42 percent in the 2000-2001 UDHS. The median duration of pregnancy for the first antenatal visit is 5.5 months, indicating that Ugandan women start antenatal care at a relatively late stage in pregnancy.  

- Child health : Forty-six percent of children age 12-23 months have been fully vaccinated. Over nine in ten (91 percent) have received the BCG vaccina­tion, and 68 percent have been vaccinated against measles. The coverage for the first doses of DPT and polio is relatively high (90 percent for each). However, only 64 percent go on to receive the third dose of DPT, and only 59 per­cent receive their third dose of polio vaccine. There are notable improvements in vaccination coverage since the 2000-2001 UDHS. The per­centage of children age 12-23 months fully vac­cinated at the time of the survey increased from 37 percent in 2000-2001 to 44 percent in 2006. The percentage who had received none of the six basic vaccinations decreased from 13 percent in 2000-2001 to 8 percent in 2006. 

- Malaria : The 2006 UDHS gathered information on the use of mosquito nets, both treated and un­treated. The data show that only 34 percent of households in Uganda own a mosquito net, with 16 percent of households owning an insecticide-treated net (ITN). Only 22 percent of children under five slept under a mosquito net on the night before the interview, while a mere 10 per­cent slept under an ITN.

- Breastfeeding and nutrition : In Uganda, almost all children are breastfed at some point. However, only six in ten children under the age of 6 months are exclusively breast-fed. 

- HIV/AIDS AND stis : Knowledge of AIDS is very high and wide­spread in Uganda. In terms of HIV prevention strategies, women and men are most aware that the chances of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced by limiting sex to one uninfected partner who has no other partners (89 percent of women and 95 percent of men) or by abstaining from sexual intercourse (86 percent of women and 93 percent of men). Knowledge of condoms and the role they can play in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus is not quite as high (70 percent of women and 84 percent of men). 

- Orphanhood and vulnerability : Almost one in seven children under age 18 is orphaned (15 percent), that is, one or both par­ents are dead. Only 3 percent of children under the age of 18 have lost both biological parents. 

- Women's status and gender violence : Data for the 2006 UDHS show that women in Uganda are generally less educated than men. Although the gender gap has narrowed in recent years, 19 percent of women age 15-49 have never been to school, compared with only 5 per­cent of men in the same age group.

- Mortality : At current mortality levels, one in every 13 Ugandan children dies before reaching age one, while one in every seven does not survive to the fifth birthday. After removing districts not cov­ered in the 2000-2001 UDHS from the 2006 data, findings show that infant mortality has de­clined from 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in the 2000-2001 UDHS to 75 in the 2006 UDHS. Un­der-five mortality has declined from 158 deaths per 1,000 live births to 137.",2006-04-2006-1,"- Household

A representative probability sample of 9,864 households was selected for the 2006 UDHS survey. The sample was selected in two stages. In the first stage, 321 clusters were selected from among a list of clusters sampled in the 2005-2006 Uganda National Household Survey (UBOS, 2006c). This matching of samples was conducted in order to allow for linking of 2006 UDHS health indicators to poverty data from the 2005-2006 UNHS. The clusters from the Uganda National Household Survey were in turn selected from the 2002 Census sample frame. For the UDHS 2006, an additional 17 clusters were selected from the 2002 Census frame in Karamoja in order to increase the sample size to allow for reporting of Karamoja­specific estimates in the UDHS. Finally, 30 IDP camps were selected from a list of camps compiled by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (UN OCHA) as of July 2005, completing a total of 368 primary sampling units. Figure 1.1 shows the geographical distribution of the 368 clusters visited in the 2006 UDHS. 

In the second stage, households in each cluster were selected based on a complete listing of households. In the 321 clusters that were included in the UNHS sample, the lists of households used were those generated during the UNHS listing operations April-August 2005. The UNHS sampled ten households per cluster. All ten were purposively included in the UDHS sample. An additional 15 to 20 households were randomly selected in each cluster. The 17 additional clusters in Karamoja were listed, and 27 households were selected in each cluster. The selected IDP camps were divided into segments because of their large size, and one segment selected in each camp. Then a listing operation was carried out in the selected segment, and 30 households were selected in each camp from the segment of the map that was listed. All women age 15-49 who were either permanent residents of the households in the 2006 UDHS sample or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed. In addition, in a sub-sample of one-third of all the households selected for the survey, all men age 15-54 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey. Indicators such as total fertility rate, childhood mortality rates, and the maternal mortality ratio require a larger sample size than other indicators. These indicators are all calculated from the data provided by female respondents only. For this reason, the number of male respondents required in the sample to obtain acceptable precision in estimates of desired indicators is lower than the number of female respondents. 

Biomarkers collected in the UDHS included height and weight measurements for children under 6 years, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; anaemia testing in children age 6 to 59 months old, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; and dried blood spot collection for vitamin A testing in children age 6 to 59 months old and women age 15 to 49 years. All of these biomarkers were measured only in those households selected for the male interview-that is, one in three households. 

COMPARABILITY OF THE 2006 UDHS SAMPLE WITH SAMPLES FROM PREVIOUS UDHS SURVEYS 

The 2006 UDHS is the first UDHS to include the entire country in the sample. In previous surveys, it was necessary to exclude groups of districts because of security problems. In the 2000-2001 UDHS, areas making up the current districts of Amuru, Bundibugyo, Gulu, Kasese, Kitgum, and Pader were excluded from the sample. According to the 2002 Census, these areas comprise around 7 percent of the population of Uganda (UBOS 2006a). The 1995 UDHS excluded Kitgum and Pader, while the 1988­1989 UDHS excluded most of the Northern region. 

To show trends using comparable data, the 2006 UDHS data were run without the districts that were excluded in previous surveys. For some key indicators, the report presents two estimates from the 2006 data: one covering the entire country, and a second covering the geographic area surveyed in the 2000-2001 UDHS. Differences between these two estimates are small, seldom exceeding one or two percentage points. 

Because it was not possible to run every indicator twice, the report includes many comparisons between the 2000-2001 and 2006 surveys in which the 2006 data have not been adjusted. The report states explicitly when the 2006 data presented are adjusted; otherwise, the data are unadjusted. Comparisons that include unadjusted 2006 data should be interpreted with caution.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires were used for the 2006 UDHS, namely, the Household Questionnaire, the Women's Questionnaire, and the Men's Questionnaire. The contents of these questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires for the MEASURE DHS program. In consultation with technical institutions and local organizations, UBOS adapted these questionnaires to reflect population and health issues relevant in Uganda. The revized questionnaires were translated from English into six local languages, namely, Ateso/Karamojong, Luganda, Lugbara, Luo, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The questionnaires were pretested prior to their finalization in January and February of 2006. 

a) The Household Questionnaire was used to list all the usual members and visitors in the selected households. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. Some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. For children under age 18, survival status of the parents was determined. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, ownership of various durable goods, and ownership and use of mosquito nets. Care and support services received by orphans and other vulnerable children and disability status of household members were also collected in the Household Questionnaires. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was used to document the respondents' decision as to whether to volunteer to give blood samples for vitamin A deficiency (VAD) testing as well as to record the height, weight, and haemoglobin measurements of women age 15-49 years, men age 15-54 years, and children age 6-59 months in those households selected for these measurements.  

b) The Women's Questionnaire was used to collect information from all women age 15-49. These women were asked questions on the following topics: 
- Background characteristics (education, residential history, media exposure, etc.) 
- Birth history and childhood mortality 
- Knowledge and use of family planning methods 
- Fertility preferences 
- Antenatal and childbirth care 
- Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices 
- Vaccinations and childhood illnesses 
- Marriage and sexual activity 
- Woman's work and husband's background characteristics 
- Awareness and behavior regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
- Maternal mortality 
- Domestic violence.  

c) The Men's Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-54  living in every third household in the 2006 UDHS sample. The Men's Questionnaire collected much of the same information found in the Women's Questionnaire, but was shorter because it did not contain a detailed reproductive history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition, or maternal mortality.",NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The report also incorporates findings on needs among refugee and host community populations living in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The findings and analysis from this report has been used to support the Refugee Response Plan for 2019-2020, along with informing other programmatic, strategic, and operational decision making for the humanitarian response coordinators and partner organisations. The JMSNA aims to compare humanitarian needs across population groups and locations in order to highlight groups and areas of most concern. Consequently, it aims to answer the following research question: what is the situation for specific population groups (refugees residing within refugee settlements and host community populations) in Uganda regarding health and nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); livelihoods, environment and energy; shelter, site planning, and non-food items; education; and food security.

The JMSNA process in Uganda began in February 2018, with REACH facilitating the research design under the auspices of UNHCR and Uganda’s Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). Through the inter-agency coordination group and other coordination mechanisms, a collaborative tool was developed with input from many partners. Data collection was conducted from 2 April to 14 July, 2018, in all 30 refugee settlements. Data collection was carried out in Kampala from 6 to 16 March and 28 March to 9 April to assess the needs of refugee and host community households in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The primary objective of the 2018-19 UMIS is to provide up-to-date estimates of basic demographic and health indicators related to malaria. Specifically, the 2018-19 UMIS collected information on vector control interventions such as mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying of insecticides, on intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant women, on care seeking and treatment of fever in children, and malaria knowledge, behaviour, and practices. Children less than age 5 were tested for anaemia and malaria infection.

• Basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed in the household, including their age, sex, and relationship to the head of the household.
• Characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, number of rooms, type of fuel used for cooking, main material of the floor, roof and walls of the house, possessions of durable goods (including land), ownership of livestock, etc.

• Identification
• Hemoglobin measurement and malaria testing for children age 0-5",Uganda Bureau of Statistics,"The 2018-19 UMIS followed a two-stage sample design and was intended to allow estimates of key indicators for the following domains:
▪ National
▪ Urban and rural areas
▪ 15 regions
▪ Although they were not included as separate sampling domains, the overall sample size permitted estimates to be produced for the 14 ongoing indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention districts: Bugiri, Kaberamaido, Koboko, Lira, Otuke, Serere, Tororo, Alebtong, Amolatar, Budaka, Butaleja, Dokolo, Namutumba, and Paliisa and 11 former IRS intervention districts Oyam, Kole, Nwoya, Amuru, Agago, Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Omoro, Apac, and Lamwo.
▪ Refugee settlements in Adjumani, Arua, Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kiryandongo, Kyegegwa, Lamwo, Moyo, and Yumbe districts were included as a separate sampling domain.

The first stage of sampling involved selecting sample points (clusters) from the sampling frames; the nonrefugee areas and the refugee settlements used separate sampling frames. Enumeration areas (EAs) delineated for the 2014 National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) were used as the sampling frame for the non-refugee areas.A sampling frame developed for the National Refugees’ Survey, conducted by UBOS in collaboration with the World Bank and Office of the Prime Minister in early 2018, was used as the frame for the refugee settlement domain. A total of 320 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the 2014 NPHC. Of these clusters, 84 were in urban areas and 236 in rural areas. Urban areas were oversampled within regions in order to produce robust estimates for that domain. A total of 22 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the refugee frame.

The second stage of sampling involved systematic selection of households. For the non-refugee areas, a household listing operation was undertaken in all of the selected EAs in November and December 2018, and households to be included in the survey were randomly selected from these lists. In the selected clusters for the refugee settlements domain, listing was undertaken immediately before fieldwork in those clusters. Twenty-eight households were selected from each EA, for a total sample size of 8,878 households. Because of the approximately equal sample sizes in each domain, the sample was not selfweighting at the national level.

Note: See Appendix A of the final survey report for additional details on the sampling procedures.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires—the Household Questionnaire, the Woman’s Questionnaire, and the Biomarker Questionnaire—were used for fieldwork in the 2018-19 UMIS. Core questionnaires available from the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) were adapted to reflect the population and health issues relevant to Uganda. The modifications were decided upon at a series of meetings with various stakeholders from the NMCD and other government ministries and agencies, nongovernmental organisations, and international donors. The questionnaires were in English; UBOS arranged for translation into Luganda, Luo, Lugbara, Ateso, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were programmed onto tablet computers, enabling use of computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) for the survey. The Biomarker Questionnaire was filled out on hard copy and entered into the CAPI system when complete.

A fourth questionnaire, the Fieldworker Questionnaire, was adapted from The DHS Program’s standard questionnaire. It was completed by all fieldworkers in the 2018-19 UMIS; its purpose was to collect basic background information on the people who collect data in the field.","A spreadsheet containing all sampling parameters and selection probabilities was constructed to facilitate the calculation of sampling weights. Household sampling weights and individual sampling weights were calculated by adjusting the previous calculated weight to compensate household nonresponse and individual nonresponse, respectively. These weights were further normalised at the national level to produce unweighted cases equal to weighted cases for both households and individuals at the national level. The normalised weights are valid for estimation of proportions and means at any aggregation levels, but not valid for estimation of totals.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

However, the recent refugee influx that doubled the number of refugees in the country in less than three years represents a challenge for the institutions, programs and mechanisms in place. The recent arrivals have put additional pressure on the public services delivery system, and to some central elements of the response approach, such as land availability for refugee use. The influx is also aggravated by the fact that refugee hosting areas were already vulnerable due to underlying poverty, limited resilience to shocks, limited capacity of local institutions, and low levels of human capital. Without the adequate response, the prolonged and steady refugee influx represents a challenge for the sustainability of Uganda’s approach.

Moreover, it is representative of the refugee and host population in the regions of West Nile and South West, and the city of Kampala. The host population is defined as the native population in districts where refugee settlements are situated. The survey used two different sampling frames. The first one, based on the list of Enumeration Areas (EAs) and the information of the 2014 Uganda Population and Housing Census, was used to determine the samples for the host and refugee populations of Kampala, and the host populations in West Nile and Southwest. The second one is a newly developed sampling frame for the refugee population in the West Nile and Southwest regions.

Given the nature of the survey, the sample is stratified by three separate domains. The first domain is the host population in the regions of West Nile and South West. The second is the refugee population in the regions of West Nile and Southwest, and the third, the refugee and host population in Kampala. A total of 221 primary sample units were allocated to the three different domains. For each domain, the sample was obtained based on a two-stage stratified sample of households. In the first stage, PSUs were selected using a Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling method. For the host communities and Kampala, before the selection of the PSUs, district EAs were sorted by residence type (urban/rural), district sub-county, parish, village and EAs. For Kampala, only EAs that contained more than ten refugee households according to the 2014 Census were considered. With this sorting and PPS for the selection of PSUs, implicit stratification by residence type was achieved. For the refugee settlements, EAs were sorted based on the Settlement, Zone, Block, Cluster, Village, EA and by dominant country of origin. The latter was intended to ensure that PSUs with refugees coming from different countries of origin were selected.

Between the first and second stages, a household listing operation was carried out in all selected PSUs outside Kampala. For the listing operation, all selected PSUs were visited and the residential households were located with their address and the name of the household head was recorded. In the second stage, for each selected PSU, ten households were selected from the newly established list using a systematic sampling approach. Household selection was performed in the field prior to the main survey and interviewers only interviewed selected households. This means that no replacements or changes to selected households was allowed in the implementation stage in order to prevent bias. With this design, the survey selected 2,209 residential households, distributed geographically across 13 districts of Uganda

No longer focusing exclusively on short-term, life-saving interventions, the response should act as a vector for refugees’ integration in the economy; improving management of land, water and natural resources; exploiting the socio-economic opportunities associated with the refugees’ presence, skills and development; and strengthening the hosting districts’ capacity to absorb and manage these resources.  The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration. 

In August 2017, FAO was asked by the Commissioner for Refugees (Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda, OPM) to support the implementation of a socio-economic analysis within the refugees’ settlements and host communities, with the aim of providing a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the refugees’ food security, well-being and resilience. Although refugees in Uganda are given land and mobility rights, their food security remains low, with a high dependency on food aid. The assumption was that by better understanding refugees’ preferences and livelihoods strategies which determine their resilience, it would be possible to unlock the development potential of the land, increase productivity and help them achieve independence and self-reliance.

In Ukraine, UNHCR provides individual protection assistance in the following regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Zakarpattya (also covers Lviv) and Kharkiv regions. The UNHCR Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) support only vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers. The type of assistance vary depending on the needs and vulnerability of persons of concern. 
the following types of CBI assistance that were provided to refugees and asylum-seekers by UNHCR and its Partners in Ukraine in 2020: 
1. Supplementary assistance and newcomers assistance 
- Modality: voucher (Metro cards, a supermarket chain that partners with UNHCR)
- Available only in Kyiv and Odesa 
- Description: Distribution of vouchers (Metro cards) for food and non-food items to refugees and asylum-seekers who meet established vulnerability criteria (newcomers, PoCs in need of supplementary food or hygiene due to medical condition). In 2020, 121 families residing in Kyiv and Odesa received voucher assistance at least once. 

In 2020 UNHCR used Metro Cash&Carry (big supermarket chain) cards in the value of 500 UAH. However, due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions imposed by the government of Ukraine, UNHCR Ukraine has gradually shifted to provision of these types of assistance through other modalities. This PDM focused only on the cases processed through vouchers. 

2. MSA (Monthly Subsistence Allowance) 
- Modality: cash. OTC (over the counter) 
- Available in Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv 
Description: MSA (monthly subsistence allowance) aims to support the most vulnerable persons of concern. It is given based on the strict vulnerability criteria and cases are reviewed every four months at the MSA committee meetings, composed of partner social counselors, SMS and UNHCR. In 2020, 105 vulnerable families were covered by this type of support. 

The amount of MSA is calculated based on the family size.
