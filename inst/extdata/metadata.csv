The primary focus of the assessments were IDPs and IDP returnees who account for the majority of the households interviewed in these assessments.

The objective of the assessment was to assess the relevance of UNHCR and WFP's targeting in the context of Burundian refugees and possibly develop a targeting strategy harmonized as much as possible with other refugee populations in DRC.

A secondary objective was to introduce barcodes linked to unique identifiers used in registration. This vulnerability assessment was conducted through an exhaustive inventory of all refugee households living in the Lusenda and Mulongwe camps (South Kivu) as well as those living outside the camps and who went to the interview locations in the camps. The survey targeted Burundian refugee households assisted by WFP and UNHCR. The data collected during the survey are quantitative and were supplemented by qualitative data collected in February 2021 in the camps of Lusenda and Mulongwe through four focus group discussions per camp for a total of eight focus groups. All refugee households in Lusenda and Mulongwe camps as well as those living outside the camp, were interviewed with a core set of questions (see variable `TypeEnquete`, response `Ciblage`).

Most refugees in Kenya live in camps located in the impoverished counties of Turkana (40 percent) and Garissa (44 percent), while 16 percent inhabit urban areas—mainly in Nairobi but also in Mombasa and Nakuru.
Refugees in Kenya are not systematically included in national surveys, creating a lack of comparable socioeconomic data on camp-based and urban refugees, and their hosts. As the third of a series of surveys focusing on closing this gap, this Socioeconomic Survey of Urban Refugees's aim is to understand the socioeconomic needs of urban refugees in Kenya, especially in the face of ongoing conflicts, environmental
hazards, and others shocks, as well as the recent government announcement to close Kenya’s refugee camps, which highlights the potential move of refugees from camps into urban settings
The SESs are representative of urban refugees and camp-based refugees in Turkana County. For the Kalobeyei 2018 and Urban 2020–21 SESs, households were randomly selected from the UNHCR registration database (proGres), while a complete list of dwellings,
obtained from UNHCR’s dwelling mapping exercise, was used to draw the sample for the Kakuma 2019 SES. The Kalobeyei SES and Kakuma SES were done via Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). Due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, the Urban SES
was collected via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). The Kalobeyei SES covers 6,004 households; the Kakuma SES covers 2,127 households; and the Urban SES covers 2,438 households in Nairobi, Nakuru, and Mombasa. 
Questionnaires are aligned with national household survey instruments, while additional modules are added to explore refugee-specific dynamics. The SES includes modules on demographics, household characteristics, assets, employment, education, consumption, and expenditure, which are aligned with the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) 2015–16 and the recent Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS) 2019.

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the survey data was collected via telephone. Hence, the survey is representative of households with active phone numbers registered by UNHCR in urban Kenya – Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru.  A sample size of 2,500 was needed to ensure a margin of error of less than 5 percent at a confidence level of 95 percent for groups represented by at least 50 percent of the population. 
  The sample for the urban SES is designed to estimate socioeconomic indicators, such as food insecurity, for groups whose share represents at least 50 percent of the population. Considering the total urban refugee population as of August 2020 and the proportions of main countries of origin, as well as a 10 percent nonresponse rate, the target sample size is 2,500 households in total, with 1,250 in Nairobi, 700 in Nakuru, and 550 in Mombasa. A total of 2,438 households were reached: 1,300 in Nairobi, 409 in Nakuru, and 729 in Mombasa. 
  The units in ProGres list are UNHCR proGres families, which are different from households as defined in standard household surveys. Upon registration, UNHCR groups individuals into ‘proGres’ families which do not necessarily meet the criteria to be considered a household. A proGres family is usually comprised by no more than one household. In turn, a household can be integrated by one or more proGres families.
Households were selected as the unit of observation to ensure comparability with national household surveys. Households are a set of related or unrelated people (either sharing the same dwelling or not) who pool ration cards and regularly cook and eat together. As proGres families were sampled, the identification of households was done by an introductory section that confirms that each member of the selected proGres family is a member of the household and whether there are other members in the households that belong to other ProGres families. Thus, the introductory section documents the number of proGres families present in the household under observation.
Before selecting the survey strata, the team attempted to better understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phones. From the proGres data, phone penetration in urban areas is high (Nairobi and Mombasa: 93 percent, Nakuru: 95 percent). To understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phone, we looked at socio-economic outcomes for proGres family refugees with access to a phone number and those without",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],NA,"The sampling weights were constructed using the outline in Himelein (2014): i) as the first step, the base weight was computed, equal to 1 for all households.

To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), though we do not have information for all of the steps:

Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on characteristics of the household head (i.e. education, labor force status, demographic characteristics), characteristics of the household (consumption, assets, financial characteristics), and characteristics of the dwelling (house ownership, overcrowding). While the proGRES database is limited in the number of socio-economic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the proGRES database.

Against the background of ever-limited resources and recognizing that the refugee population is not homogeneously vulnerable, in mid-2021 WFP and UNHCR initiated the shift to the targeted provision of food assistance based on needs.
  A targeting strategy – developed by UNHCR and WFP with support from the Joint UNHCR-WFP Programme Excellence and Targeting Hub - was formulated with the following objectives:
- Identify vulnerable refugee households in need of humanitarian assistance and less vulnerable refugees with higher livelihood resilience who would benefit from livelihoods support;
- Ensure the greatest protection outcomes through strong community participation, communications with refugee communities and risk analysis to inform the approach.
  This second JPDM has served to ensure that the corporate practice of post-distribution monitoring is fulfilled. Additionally, it assessed the extent to which the targeting approach has – over a period of five months between May and September 2021 – achieved the above objectives.

  In addition, to better understand the vulnerability status of households receiving various assistance since the targeting started, the sampling of the 2nd JPDM was also designed to be representative at the assistance group level. Same as the first JPDM, the assessment team used the total number of ProGres Groups by the time the survey was designed (August 2021) as the most reliable proxy to the total number of households, hence the sample frame. The sample size was planned to reach (a minimum of) 2,400 households in total with 95% confidence level and 5% margin error while factoring a 15% non-response rate. The distribution of the households by camp and by eligibility group was proportional to the distribution of number of the total population in each stratification.

Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad are particularly affected. Since 2014, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Far North region of Cameroon has steadily increased due to attacks by armed groups, in particular Boko Haram and rival groups. The situation of IDPs is worrying for the authorities.

In 2019, new waves of conflict and violence, associated with flooding, triggered more internal displacement. As of October 2021, the Far North region had 341,535 IDPs and 124,310 returnees (IOM DTM Round 22). In order to ensure the protection of IDPs in the three departments most affected in the Far North (Mayo-Sava, Mayo-Tsanaga et Logone-Et-Chari), a need was expressed by the different actors in the region and the authorities for credible detailed statistics on the IDP households and individuals that could be used for planning purposes. In this light, UNHCR supported the authorities in undertaking an IDP pilot profiling exercise between July and September 2021 in Mayo-Tsanaga.

The profiling collected data on a number of topics that could be used to assess the needs of the IDP population and identify solutions, namely living conditions, food security, essential items and legal protection. The profiling was carried out by UNHCR and the Comité Mixte de Protection which composed mainly of public service agents in the department of Mayo-Tsanaga. The profiling covered 85,908 IDPs in 17,572 households in 201 sites and villages.

In these locations, large populations of refugee-returnees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities live together. Within these PARR locations, UNHCR implemented its short and medium-term Community-based Protection and Solutions Programme Response (CO-PROSPER) programmes to promote long-term development initiatives. UNHCR aimed to develop an area-based, humanitarian-development-peace triple nexus response to support durable solutions and create conducive conditions for the sustainable reintegration of displaced persons.
To understand the impact of these programmes on the PARR locations, IMPACT Initiatives (IMPACT) conducted an evaluation of the impact of the programmes in PARR locations across four different dimensions: 1) community leadership inclusivity, 2) strengthening public services and equitable access, 3) income generation and economic empowerment, and 4) peacebuilding, and created indices to measure progress over these four key objectives that can be compared against the programme goals.

The information obtained through the survey was then enhanced and supplemented by information gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KII), which allowed for more nuanced and elaborated discussions and enabled UNHCR to capture the views of population groups (including children, youth, older refugees, persons with disabilities, female heads of households, LGBTIQ+ refugees, and parents of school-age children) whose voices are often under-represented.

UNHCR surveyed a representative sample of women and men and a range of age groups (15 to 17, 18 to 59, and 60 and over) among Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, and Thailand. The sampling methodology and sample sizes chosen ensured a low margin of error (7.5%) and provided a high degree of confidence (90%) that the results obtained from the portion of the population interviewed are representative of the views of the whole. This methodology also allows for statistically confident comparisons of the concerns and intentions of Rohingya refugees across different genders, ages, profiles, and countries of asylum.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Because the large-scale return of Malians is not yet a viable option, Mauritania has committed itself to a policy of inclusion. It thus requested support from the UNHCR-WFP Targeting Hub to facilitate the inclusion of Malian refugees in the national social registry. Accordingly, the two UN agencies assisted Mauritania’s National Social Registry to conduct a socio-economic census to identify  the most vulnerable households to target for prioritized assistance. Around 14,000 households were interviewed.

The purpose of the census was to:
-	Collect socio-economic information on all refugees in Bassikounou to understand needs at household level
-	Categorize refugee households based on their degree of vulnerability to inform programmatic decisions and joint targeting approaches
-	Include all refugees in the national Social Registry

CBIs also directly complement community protection measures and support the local economy and can contribute to peaceful coexistence within and across communities. UNHCR Afghanistan has used cash-based interventions for several years for a wide range of purposes, including voluntary repatriation, basic needs, community-based protection, and livelihoods among others. UNHCR seeks to improve cash programming by regularly and systematically collecting information through post-distribution monitoring (PDM) on several aspects related to UNHCR’s CBIs including efficiency of cash delivery, access to markets, use of cash, unmet needs and coping strategies. Findings are expected to help UNHCR to improve the way the CBIs are designed and delivered.
This PDM covers two CBI programmes delivered by UNHCR in in the Eastern Region of Afghanistan in 2020, cash for protection and cash for shelter. Cash for protection was designed to support households with specific protection profiles to cope with the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 and avoid harmful coping strategies. Cash for shelter was designed to support vulnerable households with conditional cash grants to construct safe and dignified shelter. While the programmes were carried out countrywide, supporting 13,792 households with cash for protection and 506 with cash for shelter, the Eastern Region supported the largest number of CBI recipients. As such, this region was prioritized for the PDM data collection which took place in Kunar, Laghman, Nangarhar, and Nuristan provinces.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted in the 4 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo, Ifo 2 and Hagadera) between 28 August and 23 September 2017 by nutrition partners (MSF-Switzerland, Islamic Relief Kenya, International Rescue Committee and Kenya Red Cross) with overall coordination by UNHCR supported by WFP.
 
After the increase in the prevalence of GAM observed in 2016 (10.2% weighted prevalence of GAM in all camps from 8.1% in 2015), the 2017 SENS indicated weigthed prevalence of GAM 9.7% which is close to what it was in 2016. The difference between the weighted prevalence of GAM in all the camps in 2016 and 2017 is not statistically significant. However, its to be mentioned that the prevalence of GAM in Dagahaley, Hagdera, and Ifo 2 camp is 8.3%, 8.6%, and 9.4% which is classified as POOR nutrition sitation, while in Ifo camp its 12.7% classified as SERIOUS nutrition sitaition as per the WHO classiciation of the public health significance. Overall, weighted anaemia prevalence showed a sharp increase among children aged 6-59 months to 60.7%, up from 49.7% in 2016. This is well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold) and requires attention. In all camps, anaemia was well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold). The children 6-23 age group had the highest prevalence of anaemia; however, the prevalence in the children 24-35 age group was also very concerning as it was above the critical threshold in all camps.",2017-08-28-2017-09-2,"Children 0-23 months

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The 2-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters from each of the 3 camps. At the first stage, a list of blocks was made before the required number were selected using sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) using ENA softwareIn nearly all cases, a cluster was the equivalent of a block. However, there were exceptions where, for some larger blocks, more than 1 cluster was selected. In this case, the blocks were split further to cater for more than one cluster. In the event that a selected block had more than 250 households, according to SMART guidance, segmentation was done, after which one of the segments was randomly selected to be the cluster.

All households in the selected clusters were labelled before data collection. At the second stage, the required number of households were selected using systematic random sampling from a list of households. A random number was selected between 1 and the sampling interval, which was calculated by dividing the total number of households in the cluster with the required number of households. The selected number became the first household to be surveyed. Subsequent households were selected by adding the sampling interval until the required number of households were completed. All eligible children below 5 years of age from all selected households were surveyed for the Child Anthropometry and Health, and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), and WASH. Half of the selected households were selected for the Food Security and Women questionnaire. The survey respondents were the primary caretakers of children below 5 years. Abandoned households were not included in the sampling frame. Absent households or households where children were absent were re-visited before the end of the day.

Gorom Refugee camp is located 24 km from Juba city. It has an estimated refugee population of 23471 who are mainly of Ethiopian nationality. The Anyuak refugees from Ethiopia have been in Gorom settlement since 2011. UNHCR and ACROSS carried out the nutrition survey in Gorom refugee camp from 16 to 20 September 2019. The overall aim of this survey was to assess the general nutrition and health status of refugee population and formulate workable recommendations for appropriate nutritional and public health interventions. 

UNHCR population figures from ProGres were used to determine the total population and that of children 6-59 months for survey planning purposes. At the end of August 2019, the Gorom refugee population was 2347 individuals. 395 (16.8%) of these were children under five years. 
An exhaustive survey was conducted in relation to children as the total population size of Gorom camp was below 2,500 people rendering sampling unnecessary following UNHCR SENS guideline. All children aged 6-59 months in the camp were surveyed. 

A total of six survey teams composed of four members each (one team leader, one haemoglobin measurer, one anthropometric measurer/translator and one anthropometric/haemoglobin measurement assistant were included in each survey. A standardized training lasting five days, which included a standardization test was provided. Data collection lasted five days. The survey teams were supported by a team of 2 supervisors and 1 coordinator who roved between the teams duration the data collection. 

Mobile phone questionnaires using Open Data Kit (ODK) android software was used for data collection for all the modules.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted between 20 August and 8 September 2018 in the 3 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo and Hagadera) to assess the magnitude and severity of malnutrition, assess trends by comparison with previous years and support programmatic decisions.

The weighted prevalence of global acutemalnutrition, the most important indicator, was 8.0% overall, falling within the POOR category (5-9%). However, there was a marked improvement from 9.7% in 2017. Only Ifo camp was within the SERIOUS category (10-14%). The high prevalence of anaemia remains a major concern, as shown by the anaemia prevalence among children which remained above the 40% critical threshold, despite having decreased. Anaemia prevalence among non-pregnant women jumped to 48.9% overall, from 43.6% in 2017 and was above the 40% threshold for all camps. Some improvement was recorded in terms of infant and young chid feeding indicators, although there is still room for improvement. The access to safe drinking water also continued to be satisfactory, while gaps were still observed in terms of sanitation.

The economic downturn, steep inflation, COVID-19 and finally the Beirut blast have pushed vulnerable communities in Lebanon - including Syrian refugees - to the brink, with thousands of families sinking further into poverty. 

The Government of Lebanon (GoL) estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million of the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled the conflict since 2011. The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains one of the largest concentration of refugees per capita in the world. 

The 2021 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) was the ninth annual survey assessing the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon to identify changes and trends in their vulnerabilities. Considering the prolonged socio-economic status in Lebanon and COVID-19, it was crucial to provide needs-based estimates on Syrian refugees in the country. Since VASyR 2021 was one of the few assessments that were conducted face-to-face, the implementation was accompanied by a comprehensive protocol to ensure the safety of families and field workers. The criticality of conducting the VASyR 2021 was to provide insights about Syrian refugees impacted by the political and economic crisis that hit Lebanon in late 2019 and by the COVID-19 outbreak.",2021-06-07-2021-07-0,Household and individual,National,Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

UNHCR database of known Syrian refugees as of 2021 served as the sample frame. Cases with missing addresses were excluded. Sampling was based on a ""30 x 7"" two-stage cluster scheme initially developed by the World Health Organization. This method outlines a sample size of 30 clusters per geographical area and seven households per cluster which provides a precision of +/- 10 percentage points. Districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure similar representativeness with other governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each, yielding 90 cluster selections for each. The governorate of Baalbek Hermel is made up of only two districts, as such, and to ensure an adequate sample in that governorate, one additional cluster sample was considered.

The primary sampling unit was defined as the village level (i.e. cluster) and UNHCR cases served as the secondary sampling unit. A case was defined as a group of people who are identified together as one unit (usually immediate family/household) under UNHCR databases. Using Emergency Nutrition Assesment (ENA) software, villages were selected using probability proportionate to size where villages with a larger concentration of refugees was more likely to be selected and 30 clusters/villages were selected with four replacement clusters, per district. 

In order to estimate the sample size needed to generate results that are representative on a district, governorate and national level, the following assumptions were used: 
- 50% estimated prevalence
- 10% precision
- 1.5 design effect 
- 5% margin of error

Using the above parameters, 165 cases per district/cluster selection was required, leading to a target of 5,000 cases nationally. Due to the known high level of mobility of the Syrian refugee population and based on experience in previous rounds of VASyR and other household level surveys, a 40% non-response rate was considered.",Face-to-face,"The 2021 VASyR questionnaire collected data at the household level and individual level including demographics, legal documentation, safety and security, shelter, WASH, health, food security, livelihoods, expenditures, food consumption, debt, coping strategies and assistance, as well as questions specifically relating to women, children and people with disabilities.","Data collected through this assessment was weighted at the district level based on the population of refugees in each district. Weighting was necessary to ensure that the geographical distribution of the population was reflected in the analysis and to compensate for the unequal probabilities of a household being included in the sample. The normalized weight was calculated for each district using the following formula:

Normalised weight = (total sample frame of the district/ total national sample frame)  / (total number of households visited in the district / total number of households visited)","Cite as follows:

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The survey aims to represent non-Syrian refugee households.

For over five decades, refugees from the Middle East and Africa have sought protection in Lebanon. These include refugees from Iraq, Sudan, Ethiopia, Egypt, Yemen and other countries, many of which have been in Lebanon prior to the Syrian crisis. The compounded crisis in Lebanon, including economic deterioration and rising inflation, COVID-19 outbreak and the Beirut port blast has impacted all persons living in Lebanon, including refugees of all nationalities.

The key objectives of the VARON include: 
• Providing a multi-sectoral update of the situation of refugees from Iraq and other countries in Lebanon through an annual household survey. The survey covers key indicators related to multiple sectors including protection, shelter, water and hygiene, health, livelihoods, socio-economic vulnerability, food security and more
•  Enhancing the targeting for the provision of multipurpose cash assistance.

UNHCR conducted an annual SENS nutrition surveys in Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement. 

The 2017 annual Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) at the Kakuma Refugee Camps was conducted from 22nd November to 3rd December 2017. It was coordinated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) with support from World Food Programme (WFP), International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Kenya Red Cross (KRC). The survey used SMART methodology and UNHCR SENS guidelines version 2 (2013) for implementation. While previous surveys indicated a steady decline in GAM prevalence between April 2010 and November 2014. 

There was a considerable increase in GAM prevalence in Kakuma from November 2015 and 2016. Though the difference was not statistically significant. However, in 2017 there has been a significant reduction in GAM prevalence in both Kakuma and Kalobeyei.

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The sample size for children, 6-59 months, was calculated using ENA for SMART software (9th, July 2015) according to UNHCR SENS guidelines (version 2 (2013). The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019. 

A two-stage cluster survey was conducted using the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry. Information on other indicators was collected and analysed using UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations (Version 2 2013) (see www.sens.unhcr.org). 

ENA for SMART selects the clusters (blocks), once done a team was sent to a block to label the households numerically with indelible pens. Population density varies across the blocks at Kakuma. If a block contained 100 households or less, all households in the block were marked.

The sampling followed a stratified multi-stage sampling approach in which villages were the primary sampling unit (PSU) and households were the secondary sampling unit (SSU), while stratification was done by target group. Accordingly, the first sampling stage consisted of selecting a sample of villages with probabilities that were proportional to size; villages with higher numbers of households had a higher probability of being selected for the survey. A random sample of households was then selected based on two approaches: systematic skips or systematic snowballing. This depended on the spatial distribution of the target groups in each
village. For example, in all camps and return villages where only IDPs reside, systematic skips were done. In villages with more target groups, systematic snowballing was performed for each target group.

Sampling limitations & specifications
- The sampling is designed to produce results representative for each target group in the locality. Analysis at the village level is not possible and therefore no reference to villages or breakdown by villages is done in the report.
- The locations targeted for the survey were not selected randomly across the localities and thus do not necessarily provide representative results of all settlement situations in the localities. The targeting of location has been based on a conflict sensitive approach and the programmatic scope of the PBF. However, the area level analysis has looked at locality as a whole and thus ounterbalance the survey scope which focused on the displaced target groups.",Face-to-face interview: Mobile,NA,NA,"PBF Sudan, DSWG Sudan, UNHCR, JIPS (2021).

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The sample size for children, 6-59 months, was calculated using ENA for SMART software (9th, July 2015) according to UNHCR SENS guidelines (version 2 (2013). The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019. 

A two-stage cluster survey was conducted using the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry.

The UDHS is the fourth com­prehensive survey conducted in Uganda as part of the worldwide Demographic and Health Sur­veys (DHS) project. The primary purpose of the UDHS is to furnish policymakers and planners with detailed information on fertility; family planning; infant, child, adult, and maternal mor­tality; maternal and child health; nutrition; and knowledge of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. In addition, in one in three households selected for the survey, women age 15-49, men age 15-54, and children under age 5 years were weighed and their height was measured. Women, men, and children age 6-59 months in this subset of households were tested for anaemia, and women and children were tested for vitamin A deficiency. The 2006 UDHS is the first DHS survey in Uganda to cover the entire country. 

The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) was designed to provide information on demographic, health, and family planning status and trends in the country. Specifically, the UDHS collected information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, and breastfeeding practices. In addition, data were collected on the nutritional status of mothers and young children; infant, child, adult, and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and levels of anaemia and vitamin A deficiency.  

The 2006 UDHS is a follow-up to the 1988-1989, 1995, and 2000-2001 UDHS surveys, which were also implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The specific objectives of the 2006 UDHS are as follows: 

- To collect data at the national level that will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly the fertility and infant mortality rates 
- To analyse the direct and indirect factors that determine the level and trends in fertility and mortality 
- To measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice of women and men by method, by urban-rural residence, and by region 
- To collect data on knowledge and attitudes of women and men about sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, and to evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use 
- To assess the nutritional status of children under age five and women by means of anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and to assess child feeding practices 
- To collect data on family health, including immunizations, prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea and other diseases among children under five, antenatal visits, assistance at delivery, and breastfeeding 
- To measure vitamin A deficiency in women and children, and to measure anaemia in women, men, and children 
- To measure key education indicators including school attendance ratios and primary school grade repetition and dropout rates 
- To collect information on the extent of disability 
- To collect information on the extent of gender-based violence. 

MAIN RESULTS

- Fertility : Survey results indicate that the total fertility rate (TFR) for the country is 6.7 births per woman. The TFR in urban areas is much lower than in the rural areas (4.4 and 7.1 children, re­spectively). Kampala, whose TFR is 3.7, has the lowest fertility. Fertility rates in Central 1, Central 2, and Southwest regions are also lower than the national level. Removing four districts from the 2006 data that were not covered in the 2000­2001 UDHS, the 2006 TFR is 6.5 births per woman, compared with 6.9 from the 2000-2001 UDHS. Education and wealth have a marked effect on fertility, with uneducated mothers hav­ing about three more children on average than women with at least some secondary education and women in the lowest wealth quintile having almost twice as many children as women in the highest wealth quintile. 

- Family planning : Overall, knowledge of family planning has remained consistently high in Uganda over the past five years, with 97 percent of all women and 98 percent of all men age 15-49 having heard of at least one method of contraception. Pills, injectables, and condoms are the most widely known modern methods among both women and men. 

- Maternal health : Ninety-four percent of women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a skilled health pro­fessional for their last birth. These results are comparable to the 2000-2001 UDHS. Only 47 percent of women make four or more antenatal care visits during their entire pregnancy, an im­provement from 42 percent in the 2000-2001 UDHS. The median duration of pregnancy for the first antenatal visit is 5.5 months, indicating that Ugandan women start antenatal care at a relatively late stage in pregnancy.  

- Child health : Forty-six percent of children age 12-23 months have been fully vaccinated. Over nine in ten (91 percent) have received the BCG vaccina­tion, and 68 percent have been vaccinated against measles. The coverage for the first doses of DPT and polio is relatively high (90 percent for each). However, only 64 percent go on to receive the third dose of DPT, and only 59 per­cent receive their third dose of polio vaccine. There are notable improvements in vaccination coverage since the 2000-2001 UDHS. The per­centage of children age 12-23 months fully vac­cinated at the time of the survey increased from 37 percent in 2000-2001 to 44 percent in 2006. The percentage who had received none of the six basic vaccinations decreased from 13 percent in 2000-2001 to 8 percent in 2006. 

- Malaria : The 2006 UDHS gathered information on the use of mosquito nets, both treated and un­treated. The data show that only 34 percent of households in Uganda own a mosquito net, with 16 percent of households owning an insecticide-treated net (ITN). Only 22 percent of children under five slept under a mosquito net on the night before the interview, while a mere 10 per­cent slept under an ITN.

- Breastfeeding and nutrition : In Uganda, almost all children are breastfed at some point. However, only six in ten children under the age of 6 months are exclusively breast-fed. 

- HIV/AIDS AND stis : Knowledge of AIDS is very high and wide­spread in Uganda. In terms of HIV prevention strategies, women and men are most aware that the chances of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced by limiting sex to one uninfected partner who has no other partners (89 percent of women and 95 percent of men) or by abstaining from sexual intercourse (86 percent of women and 93 percent of men). Knowledge of condoms and the role they can play in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus is not quite as high (70 percent of women and 84 percent of men). 

- Orphanhood and vulnerability : Almost one in seven children under age 18 is orphaned (15 percent), that is, one or both par­ents are dead. Only 3 percent of children under the age of 18 have lost both biological parents. 

- Women's status and gender violence : Data for the 2006 UDHS show that women in Uganda are generally less educated than men. Although the gender gap has narrowed in recent years, 19 percent of women age 15-49 have never been to school, compared with only 5 per­cent of men in the same age group.

- Mortality : At current mortality levels, one in every 13 Ugandan children dies before reaching age one, while one in every seven does not survive to the fifth birthday. After removing districts not cov­ered in the 2000-2001 UDHS from the 2006 data, findings show that infant mortality has de­clined from 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in the 2000-2001 UDHS to 75 in the 2006 UDHS. Un­der-five mortality has declined from 158 deaths per 1,000 live births to 137.",2006-04-2006-1,"- Household

A representative probability sample of 9,864 households was selected for the 2006 UDHS survey. The sample was selected in two stages. In the first stage, 321 clusters were selected from among a list of clusters sampled in the 2005-2006 Uganda National Household Survey (UBOS, 2006c). This matching of samples was conducted in order to allow for linking of 2006 UDHS health indicators to poverty data from the 2005-2006 UNHS. The clusters from the Uganda National Household Survey were in turn selected from the 2002 Census sample frame. For the UDHS 2006, an additional 17 clusters were selected from the 2002 Census frame in Karamoja in order to increase the sample size to allow for reporting of Karamoja­specific estimates in the UDHS. Finally, 30 IDP camps were selected from a list of camps compiled by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (UN OCHA) as of July 2005, completing a total of 368 primary sampling units. Figure 1.1 shows the geographical distribution of the 368 clusters visited in the 2006 UDHS. 

In the second stage, households in each cluster were selected based on a complete listing of households. In the 321 clusters that were included in the UNHS sample, the lists of households used were those generated during the UNHS listing operations April-August 2005. The UNHS sampled ten households per cluster. All ten were purposively included in the UDHS sample. An additional 15 to 20 households were randomly selected in each cluster. The 17 additional clusters in Karamoja were listed, and 27 households were selected in each cluster. The selected IDP camps were divided into segments because of their large size, and one segment selected in each camp. Then a listing operation was carried out in the selected segment, and 30 households were selected in each camp from the segment of the map that was listed. All women age 15-49 who were either permanent residents of the households in the 2006 UDHS sample or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed. In addition, in a sub-sample of one-third of all the households selected for the survey, all men age 15-54 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey. Indicators such as total fertility rate, childhood mortality rates, and the maternal mortality ratio require a larger sample size than other indicators. These indicators are all calculated from the data provided by female respondents only. For this reason, the number of male respondents required in the sample to obtain acceptable precision in estimates of desired indicators is lower than the number of female respondents. 

Biomarkers collected in the UDHS included height and weight measurements for children under 6 years, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; anaemia testing in children age 6 to 59 months old, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; and dried blood spot collection for vitamin A testing in children age 6 to 59 months old and women age 15 to 49 years. All of these biomarkers were measured only in those households selected for the male interview-that is, one in three households. 

COMPARABILITY OF THE 2006 UDHS SAMPLE WITH SAMPLES FROM PREVIOUS UDHS SURVEYS 

The 2006 UDHS is the first UDHS to include the entire country in the sample. In previous surveys, it was necessary to exclude groups of districts because of security problems. In the 2000-2001 UDHS, areas making up the current districts of Amuru, Bundibugyo, Gulu, Kasese, Kitgum, and Pader were excluded from the sample. According to the 2002 Census, these areas comprise around 7 percent of the population of Uganda (UBOS 2006a). The 1995 UDHS excluded Kitgum and Pader, while the 1988­1989 UDHS excluded most of the Northern region. 

To show trends using comparable data, the 2006 UDHS data were run without the districts that were excluded in previous surveys. For some key indicators, the report presents two estimates from the 2006 data: one covering the entire country, and a second covering the geographic area surveyed in the 2000-2001 UDHS. Differences between these two estimates are small, seldom exceeding one or two percentage points. 

Because it was not possible to run every indicator twice, the report includes many comparisons between the 2000-2001 and 2006 surveys in which the 2006 data have not been adjusted. The report states explicitly when the 2006 data presented are adjusted; otherwise, the data are unadjusted. Comparisons that include unadjusted 2006 data should be interpreted with caution.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires were used for the 2006 UDHS, namely, the Household Questionnaire, the Women's Questionnaire, and the Men's Questionnaire. The contents of these questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires for the MEASURE DHS program. In consultation with technical institutions and local organizations, UBOS adapted these questionnaires to reflect population and health issues relevant in Uganda. The revized questionnaires were translated from English into six local languages, namely, Ateso/Karamojong, Luganda, Lugbara, Luo, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The questionnaires were pretested prior to their finalization in January and February of 2006. 

a) The Household Questionnaire was used to list all the usual members and visitors in the selected households. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. Some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. For children under age 18, survival status of the parents was determined. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, ownership of various durable goods, and ownership and use of mosquito nets. Care and support services received by orphans and other vulnerable children and disability status of household members were also collected in the Household Questionnaires. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was used to document the respondents' decision as to whether to volunteer to give blood samples for vitamin A deficiency (VAD) testing as well as to record the height, weight, and haemoglobin measurements of women age 15-49 years, men age 15-54 years, and children age 6-59 months in those households selected for these measurements.  

b) The Women's Questionnaire was used to collect information from all women age 15-49. These women were asked questions on the following topics: 
- Background characteristics (education, residential history, media exposure, etc.) 
- Birth history and childhood mortality 
- Knowledge and use of family planning methods 
- Fertility preferences 
- Antenatal and childbirth care 
- Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices 
- Vaccinations and childhood illnesses 
- Marriage and sexual activity 
- Woman's work and husband's background characteristics 
- Awareness and behavior regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
- Maternal mortality 
- Domestic violence.  

c) The Men's Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-54  living in every third household in the 2006 UDHS sample. The Men's Questionnaire collected much of the same information found in the Women's Questionnaire, but was shorter because it did not contain a detailed reproductive history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition, or maternal mortality.",NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry and UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations was used to guide data collection for other indicators. 

The same households sampled by SMART were used in all indicators. Anaemia sample was drawn from the SMART sample size, as recommended by the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines. 
For each of the indicators used, households and individuals were sampled as follows: 

Household-level indicators: 
- WASH: every household 
- Food Security: every other household 
- Mosquito net: every other household 

Individual-level indicators: 
- Children 0-59 months: all eligible children in all households were assessed (based on the above calculations) 
- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The sample size for children, 6-59 months, was calculated using ENA for SMART software (9th, July 2015) according to UNHCR SENS guidelines (version 2 (2013). The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019. 

A two-stage cluster survey was conducted using the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology to collect and analyse data on child anthropometry. Information on other indicators was collected and analysed using UNHCR's Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) Guidelines for Refugee Populations (Version 2 2013) (see www.sens.unhcr.org). 

ENA for SMART selects the clusters (blocks), once done a team was sent to a block to label the households numerically with indelible pens. Population density varies across the blocks at Kakuma. If a block contained 100 households or less, all households in the block were marked. If a Block contained more than 100 households then the team walked around the block to identify a path that divided the block into approximately two halves. One portion of the block was selected randomly. In the selected segment of the block the team proceeded to number all households from the first to the last. If there was more than one household in a particular compound, this was indicated at the entrance of the compound (e.g. 2019 SENS HH1). The numbering and labelling was done two days prior to commencement of the survey.

Weighting: Cross-Sectional weights

For the KNBS and RDD samples, to make the sample nationally representative of the current population of households with mobile phone access, we create weights in two steps.

Step 1: Construct raw weights combining the two national samples: The current population consists of
(I) households that existed in 2015/16, and did not change phone numbers,
(II) households that existed in 2015/16, but changed phone number,
(III) households that did not exist in 2015/16.

Abstracting from differential attrition, the weights from the 2015/16 KIHBS CAPI pilot make the KIHBS sample representative of type (I) households. For RDD households, we ask whether they existed in 2015/16, when they had acquired their phone number, and where they lived in 2015/16, allowing us to classify them into type (I), (II) and (III) households and assign them to KIHBS strata. We adjust weights of each RDD household to be inversely proportional to the number of mobile phone numbers used by the household, and scale them relative to the average number of mobile phone numbers used in the KIHBS within each stratum. RDD therefore gives us a representative sample of type (II) and (III) households. We then combine RDD and KIHBS type (I) households by ex-post adding RDD households into the 2015/16 sampling frame and adjusting weights accordingly. Last, we combine our representative samples of type (I), type (II) and type (III), using the share of each type within each stratum from RDD (inversely weighted by number of mobile phone numbers). Variable: weight_raw

Step 2: Scale the weights to population proportions in each county and urban/rural stratum: We use post stratification to adjust for differential attrition and response rates across counties and rural/urban strata. We scale the raw weights from step 1 to reflect the population size in each county and rural/urban stratum as recorded in the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census conducted by the KNBS (2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census, Volume II: Distribution of Population by Administrative Units, December 2019, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-ii-distribution-of-population-by-administrative-units). Variable: weight

Panel Weights
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals:
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2)
6. Apply post-stratification in the same way as for cross-sectional weights (step 2) Variable: weight_panel_w1_2
The balanced panel weights including waves 3 and 4 were constructed using the same procedure. Variables: weight_panel_w1_2_3 and weight_panel_w1_2_3_4",UNHCR (2021).

2.Increase the understanding of the situation of Syrian refugees with disabilities and their households compared to their peers without disabilities in relation to access to services, including education.

3.Recommend inclusive actions to be prioritized by humanitarian actors.

The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration.

Although refugees in Uganda are given land and mobility rights, their food security remains low, with a high dependency on food aid.

UNHCR uses Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugees' feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilization and effectiveness of the assistance items they receive. The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided, and related services. UNHCR increasingly uses Cash-Based Interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to forcibly displaced and stateless persons in line with UNHCR's core protection mandate. In order to ensure that the cash assistance provided meets the intended programme objectives and that desired outcomes are achieved, UNHCR conducts regular post-distribution and outcome monitoring with a sample or all of refugee recipients.",2020-11-04-2020-11-2,Households,"The majority of the respondents were from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, followed by Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab.",Sample survey data [ssd],"The household survey covers the following sections:

Between April and June 2015 UNHCR installed some three dozen community lights in 50% of Rhino Camp’s 14 villages. As demand for community lighting far exceeded available funds, UNHCR worked with the refugee community and its partner the Danish Refugee Council to prioritize the strategic placement of lights within villages. The partners jointly selected locations where (1) refugees were prone to nighttime violence, theft or other safety risks, and (2) lights would promote constructive night-time activity.

Using a 72-question survey, researchers asked respondents what day- and night-time6 activities they and their children do, and whether they do these activities in lit or unlit locations. Researchers then asked respondents if they feared or had been victims of something bad while doing these activities. The phrase something bad is the English translation for the most commonly used expressions – in Nuer, Dinka, Bari, and Kiswahili – of being a victim of an aggressive act or encountering danger.

The enumerators were given instructions to select respondents randomly in the chosen camps which was not always possible for several reasons. Hence, even though the sample can be considered representative of the population under study, the potential for selection bias cannot be excluded.

The enumerators, as Rohingya refugees themselves and fluent in Rohingya, could clarify questions posed by the respondents.

The sample had 6 strata with each state as a stratum. Each stratum was divided into grids of 150 by 150 meters using GIS technology defining the enumeration areas (EAs). The number of EAs to be selected from each stratum was obtained proportional to the IDP population sizes in each state.

Technical and financial support was provided by the Palestinian Government, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

The global MICS programme was developed by UNICEF in the 1990s as an international household survey programme to support countries in the collection of internationally comparable data on a wide range of indicators on the situation of children and women. MICS surveys measure key indicators that allow countries to generate data for use in policies and programmes, and to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed upon commitments.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey has as its primary objectives:
- To furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward goals established in the Millennium Declaration and other internationally agreed upon goals, as a basis for future action.
- To contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Palestine and to strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems.

The Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2014 was conducted for a representative sample of Palestine. The survey was designed as a multi- stage cluster sample covering the entire country including two geographic regions; The West Bank which includes 11 governorates: (Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Salfit, Nablus, Ramallah and Al Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho and Al Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron) and Gaza Strip which includes 5 governorates (Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah, Deir El Balah and North Gaza) and was stratified according to urban, rural and camp areas.

Of the 11,125 households selected in the sample, results showed that the number of occupied households were 10,568 of which 10,182 households were successfully interviewed during the survey, giving a response rate of 96 percent. There were 13,964 women in the 15-49 age group of which a total of 13,367 eligible women were successfully interviewed, achieving a response rate of 96 percent. In addition, the number of children was 7,919 child in the Household Questionnaire of which a total of 7,816 child were interviewed giving a response rate of 99 percent. The total households interviewed included 56,367 individual members who were listed. Of these, 28,542 were males and 27,825 were females with a sex ratio of 103 males per hundred females.

It is noted that the Palestinian population is a young one. The percentage of individuals in the age group 0-17 years was 46 percent, whereas the percentage of individuals in the age group 18 and above was 54 percent. According to economic and social dependency categories, 39 percent individuals were in the age group 0-14 years, 58 percent in the age group 15-64 years which is the age category of economically active individuals; and 3 percent in the age group 65 years and over. The average household size in Palestine in 2014 was about 5.5 persons. About 91 percent of households are headed by men and about 9 percent of households are headed by women.

Urban, rural and camps areas in each of the governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sample size for the Palestinian MICS was calculated as 11,125 households. For the calculation of the sample size, the key indicator used was stunting prevalence among children age 0-4 years.

The number of households selected per cluster for the Palestinian MICS was determined as 25 households, based on a number of considerations, including the design effect, the budget available, and the time that would be needed per team to complete one cluster. Dividing the total number of households by the number of sample households per cluster, we obtain a sample of 445 clusters.

The 2007 census frame was used for the selection of clusters. Census enumeration areas were defined as primary sampling units (PSUs), and were selected from each of the sampling strata by using systematic pps (probability proportional to size) sampling procedures, based on the number of households in each enumeration area from the 2007 Population and Housing Census frame. The first stage of sampling was thus completed by selecting the required number of enumeration areas from each of the sixteen governorates, separately for the urban, rural and camps strata.

Since the sampling frame (the 2007 census) was not up-to-date, a listing of households was conducted in all the sample enumeration areas (EAs) prior to the selection of households. For this purpose, listing teams were formed who visited all of the selected enumeration areas and listed all households in these enumeration areas. The listing was conducted in 416 enumeration areas; this excludes 29 sample EAs in Jerusalem within the barriers J1. A total of 266 EAs were updated in the West Bank area and 150 EAs in the Gaza Strip. A 5-day training took place during the first week of September in order to provide the fieldworkers with the skills needed for conducting the listing in the sample EAs for the Palestinian Multiple Indicator Survey 2014. The main listing field work was conducted during the period September - October, 2014.

Lists of households were prepared by the listing teams in the field for each enumeration area. The households were then sequentially numbered from 1 to n (the total number of households in each enumeration area) at the Central Statistical Office, where the selection of 25 households in each enumeration area was carried out using random systematic selection procedures.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014 - Final Report"" pp.203-207.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaires for the Generic MICS were structured questionnaires based on the MICS5 model questionnaire with some modifications and additions. Household questionnaires were administered in each household, which collected various information on household members including sex, age and relationship. The household questionnaire includes List of Household Members, Education, Child Discipline, Household Characteristics, Water and Sanitation and Salt Iodization.

In addition to a household questionnaire, questionnaires were administered in each household for women age 15-49 and children under age five. The questionnaire was administered to the mother or primary caretaker of the child.

The women's questionnaire includes Woman's Background, Fertility/Birth History, Desire for Last Birth, Maternal and Newborn Health, Post-natal Health Checks, Contraception, Unmet Need, Marriage and HIV/AIDS.

The children's questionnaire includes Child's Age, Birth Registration, Early Childhood Development, Breastfeeding and Dietary Intake, Immunization, Care of Illness and Anthropometry.

The questionnaires are based on the MICS5 model questionnaire. From the MICS5 model English version, the questionnaires were customised and translated into Arabic and were pre-tested in December, 2013 in 4 clusters, out of each cluster 25 households were selected for interview, 25 households in Al-Bireh city and 25 households in Ramallah city (Urban), 25 households in Abu-Qash village (rural) and 25 in Al-Jalazoun refugee camp (refugee camps). The clusters were covered Ramallah governorate in the central of the West Bank. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires. In addition to the administration of questionnaires, fieldwork teams tested the salt used for cooking in the households for iodine content, observed the place for handwashing, and measured the weights and heights of children age under 5 years.","The Palestinian MICS sample is not self-weighting. Essentially, by allocating equal numbers of households to each of the regions, different sampling fractions were used in each region since the sizes of the regions varied. For this reason sample weights were calculated and these were used in the subsequent analyses of the survey data.

The major component of the weight is the reciprocal of the sampling fraction employed in selecting the number of sample households in the particular sampling stratum and PSU.

A final component in the calculation of sample weights takes into account the level of nonresponse for the household and individual interviews. The adjustment for household nonresponse in each stratum is equal to: 1/RRh
where RRh is the response rate for the sample households in stratum h, defined as the proportion of the number of interviewed households in stratum h out of the number of selected households found to be occupied during the fieldwork in stratum h.

The non-response adjustment factors for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires were applied to the adjusted household weights. Numbers of eligible women and under-5 children were obtained from the roster of household members in the Household Questionnaire for households where interviews were completed.

The design weights for the households were calculated by multiplying the inverse of the probabilities of selection by the non-response adjustment factor for each enumeration area. These weights were then standardized (or normalized), one purpose of which is to make the weighted sum of the interviewed sample units equal to the total sample size at the national level. Normalization is achieved by dividing the full sample weights (adjusted for nonresponse) by the average of these weights across all households at the national level. This is performed by multiplying the sample weights by a constant factor equal to the unweighted number of households at the national level divided by the weighted total number of households (using the full sample weights adjusted for nonresponse). A similar standardization procedure was followed in obtaining normalized weights for the individual women, men, and under-5 questionnaires. Adjusted (normalized) household weights varied between 0.226 and 2.316 in the 445 sample enumeration areas (clusters).

Sample weights were appended to all data sets and analyses were performed by weighting households, women, or under-5s with these sample weights.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Sampling Frame 

The sampling frame included all geographical locations in which the target population resides. The sampling frame was used to select the sample of locations for the survey. It also included the type of localities (urban, rural and refugee camps) and population size in each location. This information was taken into consideration in designing the survey sample.

Total 646,318

The frame was divided into strata depending on the homogeneity of the divided parts as follows:
A) Governorates: 16 in the West Bank and Gaza.
B) The type of locality: city, village and refugee camp.

Sample Design and Type

Three Stage Stratified Cluster Sample of 2022 persons (2022 households). The sample design was as follows:
1. Stage one: selection a sample of 60 representative localities covering all strata.
2. Stage two: selection a random sample of Palestinian households from each location selected in the first stage.
3. Stage three: random selection of one person from each household using Kish table within the age group of 18 years old and above. Half of the sample will be male and half is female respondents.

Sample Size
The sample size was 2022 persons from all Palestinian territories aged 18 years and above. Main regions covered by the sample are: the West Bank (excluding Ramallah), Ramallah and Gaza Strip. The sample was distributed as follows:

Region  / # of Households 

Ramallah and Al Bireh 350 
West Bank 1000 
Gaza Strip 672 
Total 2022 

The margin of error in the main key variables is approximately 2.5% on the entire sample size and it should be bigger in the detailed domains.

Sample Representation:

The researchers ensured that the sample is representative of the following during the field work:

1) Geographical representation: the sample distribution covers all governorates of the West Bank (including Jerusalem) and Gaza strip, thus provides a comprehensive geographical representation.
2) Economic Activity: in general, Ramallah and Al Bireh governorate is considered the economic and commercial center and thus was given a higher weight in the sample compared to the rest of the localities.
3) Economic Sectors: the sample covered different economical sectors such as employees of industrial, services and commercial sectors (usually in the main cities), workers in the agricultural sector (rural areas) and workers in the informal sector (mostly in Gaza).
4) Poverty levels: the sample covers poor localities as provided by statistics. In general, Gaza is considered poorer than the West Bank. Also, refugee camps and some localities particularly in North West Bank are considered poorer than the rest of localities and the above sample distribution provides coverage of such localities.
5) Age Groups: the sample covered all age groups above the age of 18. The reason behind selecting the starting age to be 18 is the fact that it is within this age that an individual is expected to become involved with financial transactions and thus will be dealing with financial services.
6) Gender: the sample was gender balanced; half of the respondents were males and half were females. This corresponds with the gender distribution of the Palestinian Territories.
7) Infrastructure: the sample covered central and remote localities to guarantee representation of poor versus good infrastructure and availability of services including financial services.",Face-to-face,"A standard questionnaire was previously developed by the World Bank and was adapted to the Palestinian context by Riyada Consulting.

The Palestinian Family Survey is a national household survey programme developed by PCBS based on international standard demographic health surveys as well as MICS surveys. The Palestinian Family Survey was conducted as part of the fourth global round of MICS surveys (MICS4).  The survey provides up to date information on the health, economic, and social situation of women and children; in addition to providing information on characteristics of the family in which each woman and child live as well as the main indicators about the categories of youth and elderly. This offers a study, analysis, and understanding of the actual indicators and their relationship with demographic, social, economic, and environmental variables. The survey also measures the major indicators which allows countries to monitor their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) besides measuring the level of fulfilling other internationally agreed upon commitments; in addition to enabling policy and decision makers, and intervention programs to evaluate the plans and programs, amend them, and locate the areas of intervention based on the results. The carry out of the survey also aims at updating the databases on women and children as well as building and enhancing the technical staff capabilities of carrying out surveys and analyzing data out of them. The Palestinian Family survey conducted in 2010 was led by a technical team from the Palestinians Central Bureau of Statistics, UNICEF, and UNFPA, and Ministry of Health.

The Palestinian Family Survey was conducted for a representative sample of the State of Palestine. The survey was designed as a multi- stage cluster covering all the State of Palestine including two geographic areas; The West Bank which included 11 governorates: (Jenin, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqiliya, Nablus, Ramallah & Al-Bireh, Jerusalem, Jericho & Al-Aghwar, Bethlehem, Hebron) and the Gaza Strip which include governorates (Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah, Deir El Balah and North Gaza). Of the 15,355 households selected in the sample, results showed that the number of occupied households were 14,817 of which 13,629 households were successfully interviewed during the survey, giving a response rate of 92 percent. There were 13,982 women in the 15-49 age group of which a total of 11,173 eligible women were successfully interviewed, achieving a response rate of 80 percent. In addition, 8,024 children were identified in the household questionnaire for whom a total of 7,900 mothers or child caretakers were interviewed.

Urban and rural areas and the refugee camps in each of the sixteen governorates were defined as the sampling strata.

A multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample.

The sampling frames used has been established in PCBS,and basically comprises the list of enumeration areas. (The enumeration area is a geographical area containing a number of buildings and housing units of about 120 housing units on average.)

The total frame consists of the following two parts:
1- West Bank and Gaza Sampling Frame: containing enumeration areas drawn up in 2007. In the West Bank: each enumeration area consists of a list of households with identification data to ascertain the address of individual households. In Gaza: each enumeration area contains a list of housing units with addresses to ascertain the address of individual households, plus identification data of the housing units.
2- Jerusalem Sampling Frame (J1): contains enumeration areas only, geographically divided with information about the total number of households in these areas. However, there is no detailed information about addresses inside enumeration areas and the size of the enumeration area can be ascertained without the ability to identify the addresses.

Both frames were used in the sample design and selection and therefore, the sample will differ from one frame to another. Also, the method of reaching the sample units by interviewers may differ.

In the survey, two variables were chosen to divide the population into strata, depending on the homogeneity of parts of the population.
Previous studies have shown that Palestinian households may be divided as follows:
1- Governorates: there are 16 governorates in the State of Palestine: 11 governorates in the West Bank and 5 in the Gaza Strip.
2- Locality Types: there are three types : urban, rural and refugee Camps.

After determining the sample size, which equals 15,355 households, we selected a probability sample - a multi-stage stratified cluster sample as follows:
1- First stage: selecting a sample of clusters (enumeration areas) using PPS without replacement method to obtain 644 enumeration areas from the total enumeration area frame.
2- Second stage: selecting 24 households from each selected enumeration area of the first stage and using the systematic sample method. When reaching households, all individuals were interviewed from the eligible groups i.e. women 15-54 years, elderly aged 60 years or above and children aged 0-4 years
3- Third stage: selecting one child of age group 2-14 years for part of the questionnaire and one young person from the 15-29 age group to answer the youth attachment in the questionnaireThe Kish table was used to select one child at random.
4- Also in the women's health section, the questionnaire was administered to a maximum of three randomly selected women aged 15-54 years irrespective of their marital status living in the households. In the case where 3 or less women aged 15-54 were listed in the HH all women were interviewed. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non-response cases. As for Households with 4 or more women in this age group 3 were interviewed based on the availability of these women in the household at the time of the interview. The unselected women were further treated in the dataset as non response cases.
5- The elderly age 60 years and above questionnaire was administered for all elderly persons within the household.
6- The Youth questionnaire was administered by randomly selecting a youth member from households with odd household numbers assigned at the enumeration area level. Within this sample female and male youth were alternatively selected.

The sample was allocated with proportionally using the design strata of the governorates and the locality type according to the proportion of the population in the 2007 Census.

The sampling procedures are more fully described in ""Palestinian Family Survey 2010 - Final Report"" pp.167-171.",Face-to-face,"The design of the survey complied with the standard specifications of health surveys previously implemented by PCBS. In addition, the survey included indicators of MICS4 to meet the needs of all partners.

Five sets of questionnaires were used in the survey, three are considered as main questionnaires and are based on MICS4 standard questionnaires,viz.: 1) a household questionnaire which was used to collect information on all de jure household members (usual residents), the household, and the dwelling; and a section on general health and knowledge of HIV and AIDS adminstered to three randomly selected women 15-54 years in each houehold, irrespective of marital status, 2) a women’s questionnaire administered in each household to all ever-married women aged 15-54 years (to allow for comparison with the previous survey, however, all the tables and analysis were undertaken for the women aged 15-49 only; 3) an under-5 questionnaire, administered to mothers or caretakers for all children under-5 years living in the household. The two additional country specific questionnaires were, 4) the youth aged 15-29 years old questionnaire; and 5) the elderly (60+ years old) questionnaire.

• Household Questionnaire: Covers demographic and educational characteristics, chronic disease, smoking, discipline of children (2-14 years), child labor (5-14 years), education of children (5-24 years) and housing characteristics.
• Women’s Health (15-54 years) Questionnaire: regardless of marital status, awareness about AIDS, anemia in women aged 15-49 years.
• Ever married women (15-54 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics of eligible women, reproduction, child mortality, maternal care, reproductive morbidity, family planning, and attitudes towards reproduction.
• Children under age of 5 Questionnaire: Covers children’s health, vaccination against childhood diseases, early childhood development, chronic disease, and anemia.

Supplementary Questionnaires
• Youth (15-29 years) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, awareness and perception of family planning, health status, awareness about sexually transmitted diseases and reproduction.
• Elderly (60 years and over) Questionnaire: Covers general characteristics, social relations, activities, time-use, health status, and use of mass media.

The main three questionnaires (household, women and children under-5) are based on the MICS4 model questionnaires. Using the Arabic version of the MICS4 statndard questionnaires, the questionnaires were customized to the local context and were piloted in February 2010. Based on the results of the pilot, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires.","Sampling weights are necessary to make the results of the sample are representative to the target population, and to adjust the bias resulting from differences between the sample characteristics and the reference population characteristics which mainly coming from the non-response and non-coverage of the frame.

The steps of calculation the design weight:
1- In the first stage: the weight of enumeration areas (PSUs) were calculated depending on the probability of each enumeration area((PPS) sample selection).
2- In the second stage: the weight of households were calculated in each enumeration area.
3- Design households weights resulted from product of weights of first stage and second stage.
4- Merging design households weights to the households file and to the household individuals file, each individual obtained the weight of his/her household weight ,and it is considered initial weight for individuals (all households members)

Adjustment of sample weights for non-response:
The weights of the households and individuals were adjusted to non-response cases, which are explained in the result of the interview, and we got the adjusted weights for non- response of the sample.
The adjustment factor for household non-response is equal to:
Fnr = sample of occupied households in stratum h /sample of interviewed households in stratum h
Similarly, the adjustment factor for non-response at the individual level (women and under-5 children) for each stratum is equal to:
Fnr = Eligible women (or under-5s) in stratum h /Completed women’s (or under-5’s) questionnaires in stratum h These factors were multiplied by the design weights to get the adjusted weights for non-response.

Weights Calibration (post-stratification):
This form of weighting adjustment compensates for differences between the achieved distribution for the sample for some characteristic and known population distribution for that characteristic (hlweight). The source of distributions are population counts from projections. Furthermore, the population in the control totals should match the population surveyed. For example, if a population was excluded from the survey due to age groups, the same population should be excluded from the projections. the post-stratification method of adjustment was used to compensate for non-coverage.

Standardization of weights:
Standardized weights obtained from dividing the weights of the sample unit by the average of the weights, so the weights were standardized in such way that the total weighted sample interviewed is equal to the total unweighted.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The survey is designed to provide estimates of key malaria indicators for the country as a whole, urban and rural areas separately, each of the 15 regions, and refugee settlements.

The primary objective of the 2018-19 UMIS is to provide up-to-date estimates of basic demographic and health indicators related to malaria. Specifically, the 2018-19 UMIS collected information on vector control interventions such as mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying of insecticides, on intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant women, on care seeking and treatment of fever in children, and malaria knowledge, behaviour, and practices. Children less than age 5 were tested for anaemia and malaria infection.

The information collected through the 2018-19 UMIS is intended to assist policy makers and programme managers in evaluating and designing programmes and strategies for improving the health of the country’s population.",2018-12-11-2019-01-3,"- Household

HOUSEHOLD
• Identification
• Usual members and visitors in the selected households
• Basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed in the household, including their age, sex, and relationship to the head of the household.
• Characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, number of rooms, type of fuel used for cooking, main material of the floor, roof and walls of the house, possessions of durable goods (including land), ownership of livestock, etc.
• Mosquito nets

WOMAN
• Identification
• Background characteristics (age, residential history, education, literacy, religion, and ethnicity)
• Reproductive history for the 6 years before the survey
• Prenatal care and preventive malaria treatment for the most recent live birth
• Prevalence and treatment of fever among children under age 5
• Knowledge and opinions about malaria (symptoms, causes, how to prevent, and types of antimalarial medications)
• Exposure to and sources of messages about malaria

BIOMARKER
• Identification
• Hemoglobin measurement and malaria testing for children age 0-5",Uganda Bureau of Statistics,"The 2018-19 UMIS followed a two-stage sample design and was intended to allow estimates of key indicators for the following domains:
▪ National
▪ Urban and rural areas
▪ 15 regions
▪ Although they were not included as separate sampling domains, the overall sample size permitted estimates to be produced for the 14 ongoing indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention districts: Bugiri, Kaberamaido, Koboko, Lira, Otuke, Serere, Tororo, Alebtong, Amolatar, Budaka, Butaleja, Dokolo, Namutumba, and Paliisa and 11 former IRS intervention districts Oyam, Kole, Nwoya, Amuru, Agago, Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Omoro, Apac, and Lamwo.
▪ Refugee settlements in Adjumani, Arua, Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kiryandongo, Kyegegwa, Lamwo, Moyo, and Yumbe districts were included as a separate sampling domain.

The first stage of sampling involved selecting sample points (clusters) from the sampling frames; the nonrefugee areas and the refugee settlements used separate sampling frames. Enumeration areas (EAs) delineated for the 2014 National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) were used as the sampling frame for the non-refugee areas.A sampling frame developed for the National Refugees’ Survey, conducted by UBOS in collaboration with the World Bank and Office of the Prime Minister in early 2018, was used as the frame for the refugee settlement domain. A total of 320 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the 2014 NPHC. Of these clusters, 84 were in urban areas and 236 in rural areas. Urban areas were oversampled within regions in order to produce robust estimates for that domain. A total of 22 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the refugee frame.

The second stage of sampling involved systematic selection of households. For the non-refugee areas, a household listing operation was undertaken in all of the selected EAs in November and December 2018, and households to be included in the survey were randomly selected from these lists. In the selected clusters for the refugee settlements domain, listing was undertaken immediately before fieldwork in those clusters. Twenty-eight households were selected from each EA, for a total sample size of 8,878 households. Because of the approximately equal sample sizes in each domain, the sample was not selfweighting at the national level.

Note: See Appendix A of the final survey report for additional details on the sampling procedures.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires—the Household Questionnaire, the Woman’s Questionnaire, and the Biomarker Questionnaire—were used for fieldwork in the 2018-19 UMIS. Core questionnaires available from the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) were adapted to reflect the population and health issues relevant to Uganda. The modifications were decided upon at a series of meetings with various stakeholders from the NMCD and other government ministries and agencies, nongovernmental organisations, and international donors. The questionnaires were in English; UBOS arranged for translation into Luganda, Luo, Lugbara, Ateso, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were programmed onto tablet computers, enabling use of computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) for the survey. The Biomarker Questionnaire was filled out on hard copy and entered into the CAPI system when complete.

A fourth questionnaire, the Fieldworker Questionnaire, was adapted from The DHS Program’s standard questionnaire. It was completed by all fieldworkers in the 2018-19 UMIS; its purpose was to collect basic background information on the people who collect data in the field.","A spreadsheet containing all sampling parameters and selection probabilities was constructed to facilitate the calculation of sampling weights. Household sampling weights and individual sampling weights were calculated by adjusting the previous calculated weight to compensate household nonresponse and individual nonresponse, respectively. These weights were further normalised at the national level to produce unweighted cases equal to weighted cases for both households and individuals at the national level. The normalised weights are valid for estimation of proportions and means at any aggregation levels, but not valid for estimation of totals.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Tanzania,TZA,2003,Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire 2003,427,DDI_WBG_TZA_2003_CWIQ_v01_M,Development Data Group,EDI Ltd (Economic Development Initiatives),Joachim De Weerdt - Research Director/EDI Ltd (Economic Development Initiatives)/j.deweerdt@edi-africa.com /http://www.edi-africa.com/research/cwiq.htm,"The Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) currently constitutes one of the largest socio-economic household survey databases on Tanzania. Since 2003 EDI has interviewed roughly 20,000 households in 35 different districts. For 9 districts repeat surveys have been organised to track changes over time.

Rationale: Absence of district level survey data does not rhyme with the devolution of power to districts. Tanzania is undergoing a decentralisation process whereby each of its roughly 128 districts is becoming an increasingly important policy actor. A district taking on this challenge needs accurate information to monitor and develop its own policies. Much relevant information is currently not available as national statistics are not representative at district level and many of the routine data collection mechanisms are still under development. CWIQ then provides an attractive, one-stop survey-based method to collect basic development indicators. Furthermore, the survey results can be disseminated - through Swahili briefs and posters - to a district's population; thus increasing the extent to which people are able to hold their local governments accountable. Exciting new ground is being broken on such population-wide dissemination by the Prime Minister's Office.

Methodology: The data are collected through a small 10-page questionnaire, called the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ). The questionnaire and data software constitute an off-the-shelf survey package developed by the World Bank to produce standardised monitoring indicators of welfare. The questionnaire is purposively concise and is designed to collect information on household demographics, employment, education, health and nutrition as well as utilisation and satisfaction with social services. Questionnaires are scannable, with interviewers shading bubbles and writing numbers later recognised by the scanning software. The data system is fully automated allowing the results to roll out within weeks of the fieldwork.

Funding: projects are typically funded by organisations that care about making decentralisation work in Tanzania. CWIQ is a method to promote evidence-based policy formulation and debate in the district and a tool for the population to hold their local governments accountable. With funding from the RNE (Royal Netherlands Embassy) and SNV (Stichting Nederlands Vrijwilligers), CWIQ surveys were implemented between 2003-2005 in 16 districts. In 2006/07 PMO-RALG (Prime Minister's Office - Regional Administration and Local Government) commissioned EDI to cover a further 28 districts. In 9 of these districts this constituted a repeat survey and thus a unique opportunity arises to monitor changes that occurred in the district over this time period. 

Dissemination: EDI disseminated the results of CWIQ on posters and briefs to district level stakeholders (councillors, district officials, NGOs, CBOs, Advocacy Groups, MPs, 'interested citizens', etc.), with the aim at district level, to: (i) promote evidence-based policy debate, (ii) promote evidence-based policy formulation, (iii) provide tools for district level M&E and (iv) increase accountability of LGA to citizens. 

Public Domain: Currently in the public domain are (i) all CWIQ reports - note that Shinyanga 2004 and Kagera 2003 reports are organised into one region-wide report (ii) Swahili and English briefs for 5 pilot dissemination districts funded by the Prime Minister's Office - and (iii) raw data for all CWIQs conducted between 2003 and 2007.",isting Households-2003-07-2003-07;Supervisor and Interviewer Training -2003-10-2003-10;Field Work-2003-11-2003-1,"- Households

RIDHS collected the indicators on fertility, family planning and maternal and child health which the survey normally provides. In addition, RIDHS integrated a malaria module and tests for the prevalence of malaria and anemia among women and children, thus determining the prevalence of malaria and anemia for women and children at the national level.

The main objectives of the RIDHS were:
• At the national level, gather data to determine demographic rates, particularly fertility and infant and child mortality rates, and analyze the direct and indirect factors that determine fertility and child mortality rates and trends.
• Evaluate the level of knowledge and use of contraceptives among women and men.
• Gather data concerning family health: vaccinations; prevalence and treatment of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections (ARI), and fever in children under the age of five; antenatal care visits; and assistance during childbirth.
• Gather data concerning the prevention and treatment of malaria, particularly the possession and use of mosquito nets, and the prevention of malaria in pregnant women.
• Gather data concerning child feeding practices, including breastfeeding.
• Gather data concerning circumcision among men between the ages of 15 and 59.
• Collect blood samples in all of the households surveyed for anemia testing of women age 15-49, pregnant women and children under age five.

- MEN: The Men’s Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-59 years living in the selected households. The Men’s Questionnaire collected information similar to that of the Women’s Questionnaire, with the only difference being that it did not include birth history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition. In addition, the Men’s Questionnaire also collected information on circumcision.",National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda,"The sample for the RIDHS is a two-stage stratified area sample. Clusters are the primary sampling units and are constituted from enumeration areas (EA). The EA were defined in the 2002 General Population and Housing Census (RGPH) (SNR, 2005). 

These enumeration areas provided the master frame for the drawing of 250 clusters (187 rural and 63 urban), selected with a representative probability proportional to their size. Only 249 of these clusters were surveyed, because one cluster located in a refugee camp had to be eliminated from the sample. A strictly proportional sample allocation would have resulted in a very low number of urban households in certain provinces. It was therefore necessary to slightly oversample urban areas in order to survey a sufficient number of households to produce reliable estimates for urban areas. The second stage involved selecting a sample of households in these enumeration areas. In order to adequately guarantee the accuracy of the indicators, the total number drawn was limited to 30 households per cluster. Because of the nonproportional distribution of the sample among the different strata and the fact that the number of households was set for each cluster, weighting was used to ensure the validity of the sample at both national and provincial levels.

All women age 15-49 years who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed (7,528 women). In addition, a sample of men age 15-59 who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible for the survey (7,168 men). Finally, all women age 15-49 and all children under the age of five were eligible for the anemia and malaria diagnostic tests.

The sample for the 2007-08 RIDHS covered the population residing in ordinary households across the country. A national sample of 7,469 households (1,863 in urban areas and 5,606 in rural areas) was selected. The sample was first stratified to provide adequate representation from urban and rural areas as well as all the four provinces and the city of Kigali, the nation’s capital.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires were used in the 2007-08 RIDHS: the Household Questionnaire, the Women’s Questionnaire, and the Men’s Questionnaire. The content of these questionnaires was based on model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS project.

Initial technical meetings that were held beginning in September 2007 allowed a wide range of government agencies as well as local and international organizations to contribute to the development of the questionnaires. Based on these discussions, the DHS model questionnaires were modified to reflect the needs of users and relevant issues in population, family planning, anemia, malaria and other health concerns in Rwanda. The questionnaires were then translated from French into Kinyarwanda. These questionnaires were finalized in December 2007 before the training of male and female interviewers.

The Household Questionnaire was used to list all of the usual members and visitors in the selected households. In addition, some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household’s dwelling unit such as the main source of drinking water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, the main energy source used for cooking and ownership of various durable goods. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women and children eligible for the hemoglobin (anemia) and malaria diagnostic tests.

The Women’s Questionnaire was used to collect information on women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and covered questions on the following topics:
• Background characteristics
• Marital status
• Birth history
• Knowledge and use of family planning methods
• Fertility preferences
• Antenatal and delivery care
• Breastfeeding practices
• Vaccinations and childhood illnesses

- Assessment of overall situation",NA,"Conducting a representative survey in Lebanon was especially challenging. The first difficulty was that, as of 2015, there was no recent or reliable sample frame, even for Lebanese households, as the last official population census was conducted in 1932. Typically, such a sample frame consists of the universe of enumeration areas in a country, with associated estimates of population. This meant that we had to construct our own sample frame by selecting a few Small Area Units (SAUs) and then conducting a full listing operation by visiting every household within the selected SAUs and collecting basic demographic and contact information. The second difficulty was that there was no available cartographic division of the country into geographic areas small enough to be the subject of a full listing operation, which could then serve as a sampling frame for the SAUs. Circonscription Foncières (CF) were the finest level of disaggregation available; CFs are generally too large to be listed as some have populations of over 100,000. Finally, there was no available sampling frame for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which meant that we had to depend on UNHCR data on registered Syrian refugees, combined with the estimates of Lebanese population at the CF level. Given these challenges and time and budgetary constraints, the sample was selected in multiple (four) stages as described Section 2 of ""Survey Design and Sampling: A methodology note for the 2015-16 surveys of Syrian refugees and host communities in Jordan, Lebanon and Kurdistan, Iraq"" document.",Face-to-face,"The survey instrument was administered across Lebanon, Jordan, and KRI, with slight modifications depending on the structure of refugee living conditions.

MICS is capable of producing statistically sound, internationally comparable estimates of social indicators. The current round of MICS is focused on providing a monitoring tool for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the World Fit for Children (WFFC), as well as for other major international commitments, such as the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS and the Abuja targets for malaria. 

Survey Objectives 
The 2006 Palestinian Refugee Camps, Lebanon Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey has as its primary objectives: 
- To provide up-to-date information for assessing the situation of children and women in Generic 
- To furnish data needed for monitoring progress toward goals established in the Millennium Declaration, the goals of A World Fit For Children (WFFC), and other internationally agreed upon goals, as a basis for future action; 
- To contribute to the improvement of data and monitoring systems in Generic and to strengthen technical expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of such systems. 

Survey Content 

MICS questionnaires are designed in a modular fashion that can be easily customized to the needs of a country. They consist of a household questionnaire, a questionnaire for women aged 15-49 and a questionnaire for children under the age of five (to be administered to the mother or caretaker). Other than a set of core modules, countries can select which modules they want to include in each questionnaire. 

Survey Implementation 

The surveys are typically carried out by government organizations, with the support and assistance of UNICEF and other partners. Technical assistance and training for the surveys is provided through a series of regional workshops, covering questionnaire content, sampling and survey implementation; data processing; data quality and data analysis; report writing and dissemination. 

Survey results 

Results from the surveys, including national reports, standard sets of tabulations and micro level datasets will all be made widely available after completion of the surveys. Results from the surveys will also be made available in DevInfo format. DevInfo v5.0 is a powerful database system which has been adapted from UNICEF's ChildInfo technology to specifically monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. MICS Results will also be available through UNICEF's web site dedicated to monitoring the situation of children and women at www.childinfo.org.

2) a women’s questionnaire administered in each household to all women aged 15-49 years; 
3) an under-5 questionnaire, administered to mothers or caretakers of all children under 5 living in the household. 

The questionnaires included the following modules: Household Questionnaire, Household Listing, Education, Water and Sanitation Facilities, Household Background Characteristics, Child Labour, and Salt Iodization.

The design was then amended to include a representative sample of the Azraq and Za'atari camps (which account for the vast majority of Syrian refugees in camps in Jordan). This sample was complemented by purposive samples of the surrounding governorates, Mafraq and Zarqa, where the sample included areas physically proximate to the camp and other areas with a high number of Syrian refugees. In Amman Governorate, a purposive sample was drawn, combining a geographically distributed sample with a sample of areas with a high prevalence of Syrian refugees per the 2015 census, as indicated by the Jordanian Department of Statistics. Analytically, this implies the insights from Jordan will be limited to camp residents, neighboring areas of the camps, and Amman governorate. For this reason, Amman is left out of the rest of the discussion, where our focus is on relating the innovative approaches that we followed to obtain near-representative sample in absence of recent sampling frame.

The 2012 JPFHS sample was designed to produce reliable estimates of major survey variables for the country as a whole, urban and rural areas, each of the 12 governorates, and for the two special domains: the Badia areas and people living in refugee camps. To facilitate comparisons with previous surveys, the sample was also designed to produce estimates for the three regions (North, Central, and South). The grouping of the governorates into regions is as follows: the North consists of Irbid, Jarash, Ajloun, and Mafraq governorates; the Central region consists of Amman, Madaba, Balqa, and Zarqa governorates; and the South region consists of Karak, Tafiela, Ma'an, and Aqaba governorates.

The 2012 JPFHS sample was selected from the 2004 Jordan Population and Housing Census sampling frame. The frame excludes the population living in remote areas (most of whom are nomads), as well as those living in collective housing units such as hotels, hospitals, work camps, prisons, and the like. For the 2004 census, the country was subdivided into convenient area units called census blocks. For the purposes of the household surveys, the census blocks were regrouped to form a general statistical unit of moderate size (30 households or more), called a ""cluster"", which is widely used in surveys as a primary sampling unit (PSU).

Stratification was achieved by first separating each governorate into urban and rural areas and then, within each urban and rural area, by Badia areas, refugee camps, and other. A two-stage sampling procedure was employed. In the first stage, 806 clusters were selected with probability proportional to the cluster size, that is, the number of residential households counted in the 2004 census. A household listing operation was then carried out in all of the selected clusters, and the resulting lists of households served as the sampling frame for the selection of households in the second stage. In the second stage of selection, a fixed number of 20 households was selected in each cluster with an equal probability systematic selection. A subsample of two-thirds of the selected households was identified for anthropometry measurements.

Refer to Appendix A in the final report (Jordan Population and Family Health Survey 2012) for details of sampling weights calculation.",Face-to-face,"The 2012 JPFHS used two questionnaires, namely the Household Questionnaire and the Woman’s Questionnaire (see Appendix D). The Household Questionnaire was used to list all usual members of the sampled households, and visitors who slept in the household the night before the interview, and to obtain information on each household member’s age, sex, educational attainment, relationship to the head of the household, and marital status. In addition, questions were included on the socioeconomic characteristics of the household, such as source of water, sanitation facilities, and the availability of durable goods. Moreover, the questionnaire included questions about child discipline. The Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women who were eligible for the individual interview (ever-married women age 15-49 years). In addition, all women age 15-49 and children under age 5 living in the subsample of households were eligible for height and weight measurement and anemia testing.

The Woman’s Questionnaire was administered to ever-married women age 15-49 and collected information on the following topics:
• Respondent’s background characteristics
• Birth history
• Knowledge, attitudes, and practice of family planning and exposure to family planning messages
• Maternal health (antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care)
• Immunization and health of children under age 5
• Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices
• Marriage and husband’s background characteristics
• Fertility preferences
• Respondent’s employment
• Knowledge of AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
• Other health issues specific to women
• Early childhood development
• Domestic violence

In addition, information on births, pregnancies, and contraceptive use and discontinuation during the five years prior to the survey was collected using a monthly calendar.

The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS program. Additions and modifications to the model questionnaires were made in order to provide detailed information specific to Jordan. The questionnaires were then translated into Arabic.

Anthropometric data were collected during the 2012 JPFHS in a subsample of two-thirds of the selected households in each cluster. All women age 15-49 and children age 0-4 in these households were measured for height using Shorr height boards and for weight using electronic Seca scales. In addition, a drop of capillary blood was taken from these women and children in the field to measure their hemoglobin level using the HemoCue system.

However, the fieldwork was disrupted in the summer of 2014 in some parts of the country due to the deterioration in the security situation.

Given the large number of people displaced within the country since 2014, the survey was designed to capture a representative sample of internally displaced persons. Furthermore, given the prevalence of Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan region, the survey also sampled refugee households in Kurdistan. A socioeconomic survey of camp residents was conducted by CSO and KRSO in 2017 so to avoid duplication of effort, the camp residents were excluded from the SWIFT survey. Informal ad-hoc settlements that have been constructed since the last update of sampling frame were included in the survey through household listing operation in the sampled enumeration areas. The survey was designed to cover all governorates, including areas in Nineveh deemed safe for field visits.

The sampling design followed a nested logic. All households in the sample responded to a short questionnaire. The short form collected information on the following core non-monetary indicators of well-being: household roster, education attainment, labor market variables, dwelling characteristics, access to basic services, asset ownership, transfers and assistance (public and private), incidence of shocks, and subjective well-being. A random subset of the sampled households also responded to the complete list of questions on household expenditure. The full sample was designed to be representative for each governorate. The expenditure sub-sample was representation at the regional level, where each region comprises three to five governorates.

Within each governorate, the out-of-camp sample was selected in two stages as following.  First, using the exhaustive list of Census Enumeration Areas as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), between 60 to 150 EAs in each governorate was selected using Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) criteria, with the number of households in each area as the measure of size.  Listing exercise was conducted in the selected areas to update the list of households. In the second stage, using households as secondary sampling units (SSUs), six households were selected in each cluster with equal probability from the post-listing sampling frame. The sample of households in the second stage was stratified by residence status. In selecting six households from a cluster, three each of IDP and non-IDP households were selected in the non-Kurdistan region. In the Kurdistan region, two each of IDP, non-IDP, and refugee households were selected. If an enumeration area in Kurdistan had fewer than two refugee or IDP households, the gap was filled by randomly selecting resident households from the same enumeration area. Likewise, if a PSU in the rest of Iraq had fewer than three IDP households, the shortfall was met by resident households to reach a total of 6 households per PSU.

Expenditure information was collected from a subsample of households from a subsample of enumeration areas. In Kurdistan, one household each of residents, IDPs, and refugees in a subset of clusters responded to the expenditure questions and in Rest of Iraq, one household each of residents and IDPs answered the expenditure questions.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],NA,NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The first difficulty was that, as of 2015, there was no recent or reliable sample frame, even for Lebanese households, as the last official population census was conducted in 1932. Typically, such a sample frame consists of the universe of enumeration areas in a country, with associated estimates of population. This meant that we had to construct our own sample frame by selecting a few Small Area Units (SAUs) and then conducting a full listing operation by visiting every household within the selected SAUs and collecting basic demographic and contact information. The second difficulty was that there was no available cartographic division of the country into geographic areas small enough to be the subject of a full listing operation, which could then serve as a sampling frame for the SAUs. Circonscription Foncières (CF) were the finest level of disaggregation available; CFs are generally too large to be listed as some have populations of over 100,000. Finally, there was no available sampling frame for Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which meant that we had to depend on UNHCR data on registered Syrian refugees, combined with the estimates of Lebanese population at the CF level. Given these challenges and time and budgetary constraints, the sample was selected in multiple (four) stages.

For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum.

Weighting: Cross-Sectional weights

For the KNBS and RDD samples, to make the sample nationally representative of the current population of households with mobile phone access, we create weights in two steps.

Step 1: Construct raw weights combining the two national samples: The current population consists of
(I) households that existed in 2015/16, and did not change phone numbers,
(II) households that existed in 2015/16, but changed phone number,
(III) households that did not exist in 2015/16.

Abstracting from differential attrition, the weights from the 2015/16 KIHBS CAPI pilot make the KIHBS sample representative of type (I) households. For RDD households, we ask whether they existed in 2015/16, when they had acquired their phone number, and where they lived in 2015/16, allowing us to classify them into type (I), (II) and (III) households and assign them to KIHBS strata. We adjust weights of each RDD household to be inversely proportional to the number of mobile phone numbers used by the household, and scale them relative to the average number of mobile phone numbers used in the KIHBS within each stratum. RDD therefore gives us a representative sample of type (II) and (III) households. We then combine RDD and KIHBS type (I) households by ex-post adding RDD households into the 2015/16 sampling frame and adjusting weights accordingly. Last, we combine our representative samples of type (I), type (II) and type (III), using the share of each type within each stratum from RDD (inversely weighted by number of mobile phone numbers). Variable: weight_raw

Step 2: Scale the weights to population proportions in each county and urban/rural stratum: We use post stratification to adjust for differential attrition and response rates across counties and rural/urban strata. We scale the raw weights from step 1 to reflect the population size in each county and rural/urban stratum as recorded in the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census conducted by the KNBS (2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census, Volume II: Distribution of Population by Administrative Units, December 2019, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-ii-distribution-of-population-by-administrative-units). Variable: weight

Panel Weights
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals:
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2)
6. Apply post-stratification in the same way as for cross-sectional weights (step 2) Variable: weight_panel_w1_2
The balanced panel weights including waves 3 and 4 were constructed using the same procedure. Variables: weight_panel_w1_2_3 and weight_panel_w1_2_3_4",UNHCR (2021).

Uganda,UGA,2019,Community Perception Survey - 2019,384,HDX_GTS_UGA_2019_CPS_DDI_v1.1,HDX,Ground Truth Solutions,N/A,"This data includes responses to Ground Truth Solutions' perception survey conducted in October 2019 with 1511 refugees in Uganda. Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.

Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).

Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. 
Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.

Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. 

Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin. Similarly, internal movement within Uganda and opportunities to migrate to a new country are areas in which refugees say they lack guidance from humanitarian agencies or other actors.",2019-10-08-2019-10-3,Individuals and households,"Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma)",Sample survey data [ssd],Admission and rights; emergency response and ongoing needs; resilience and self-reliance; expanded solutions; voluntary repatriation; demographics.,Ground Truth Solutions,"This survey is the third round of questions Ground Truth Solutions has asked in Uganda; the first round took place in 2017 and the second in 2018. As in previous rounds, respondents to the current round of questions have been selected randomly, but the respondents themselves are different from those in previous rounds. When designing the sampling strategy for this survey, we used the most recent figures for populations of refugees from the UNHCR refugee portal. Based on this data, we decided to focus on South Sudanese and Congolese refugees, as they made up 92% of all the refugees in Uganda at the time. Refugees from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia each made up 0-3% of the overall refugee population and were excluded from this study. This is not to say that the perspectives of more marginal groups are not important, but rather that gathering these perspectives was simply beyond the scope of our research in view of the geographical and time constraints involved. In terms of the locations selected, we decided to include Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja (and to exclude Kampala, Lobule, Oruchinga, and Palabek), as over 90% of South Sudanese and Congolese refugees reside in these refugee settlements, according to UNHCR's most recent figures. 

The actual sample size achieved was 1,511 participants from 10 refugee settlements across Uganda, and the sample size in each settlement was proportional to the population size of the targeted communities within any given settlement. Using a confidence level of 95%, this sample size affords an expected margin of error of 3%. 

Ground Truth Solutions co-led enumerator training and supervised data collection on the ground. Within each of the 10 selected settlements, we chose particular zones from which to collect data, and within these zones, we selected smaller village/cluster units. In selecting the zones, we grouped them into two or three tiers, depending on the population size within the given zones of the camp, and asked the data collection partner to select one zone from each tier in order to capture responses from differently sized areas. Within the zones, a GTS supervisor, in consultation with local leaders and actors on the ground, selected the villages/clusters based on several factors, such as when they were established, their distance from central points, and their population size.",Face-to-face,"Survey questions were developed to help understand refugees’ perceptions of the aid they receive, their relationship with humanitarian workers and the host community, and their future prospects. For the purpose of comparing this data with previous rounds, the questions in this round are phrased similarly to those in rounds one and two wherever possible. We consulted local actors and organisations in Uganda for feedback and input during the survey question design phase. Draft questions were also presented to UNHCR, the Assessment Technical Working Group (ATWG), the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), and the Office of the Prime Minister.

A probabilistic sampling approach was used for IDPs from Somaliland, refugee returnees, economic migrants and host community living in settlements. The sample in the settlements was stratified by population group and was representative at the total population level. The distribution of each population group was proportionate to their size in each settlement and was considered when distributing the sample across the settlements. For the IDPs from South Central Somalia and refugees/asylum seekers, a non- probabilistic sampling approach was adopted due to the relatively small size of these population groups and scattered distribution in the urban area of Hargeisa. For the IDPs originating from south- central Somalia and residing in the urban areas of Hargeisa outside of the known settlements, the profiling deployed respondent- driven sampling, whereby the individuals being surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know. In turn, the next individuals surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know, and so forth (snowball sampling).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites (about 40% of the total refugees in Kenya), and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey replicates the preceding Kalobeyei SES (2018), designed to address these shortcomings and support the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals. Data was collected in October 2019 to December 2019, covering about 2,122 households.",2019-10-21-2019-12-1,Household and individual,"Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya",Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey included a range of socio-economic indicators, both at the household and individual household member levels, aligned with the national 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) and the 2019 Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS). 

The SES is designed to be representative of all households living in Kakuma, which are defined as groups of people who regularly cook and share meals together. The Kakuma SES covers 2,122 households across the four Kakuma subcamps.

The scope of the questionnaire includes:
- Education 
- Employment 
- Household Characteristics
- Asset 
-Access to Services 
- Vulnerability
-  Social Cohesion 
-  Coping Mechanisms
- Displacement and durable solutions
- Consumption and Expenditure
      - Food   
      - Non Food
     - Education
     - Energy  
The consumption and expenditure on food and non food were collected using the rapid consumption methodology (See Pape and Mistiaen, 2018   http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/682571525377824199/pdf/WPS8430.pdf for more detailed information on this methodology)",UNHCR,"The Kakuma SES utilized a two-stage sampling process where the first stage samples dwellings, stratified by subcamp, followed by second-stage households. Dwellings were drawn as the primary sampling unit (PSU) from an up-to-date list of all dwellings in the camp provided by UNHCR shelter unit, which serves as the sampling frame. The sample was drawn with explicit stratification for the four Kakuma subcamps, with uniform probability for Kakuma 1-3. For Kakuma 4, the selection probability was slightly increased because of higher expected nonresponse 

The survey was designed to accurately estimate socioeconomic indicators such as the poverty rate for group sof the population that have at least a 50 percent representation in the population. A 3 percent margin of error at a confidence level of 95 percent is considered accurate, resulting in a sample size of 2,122. Considering a 10 percent nonresponse rate, the target sample size was 2,347.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The following sections are included: household roster, education, employment, household characteristics, assets, access, vulnerabilities, social cohesion, coping mechanism, displacement and  cunsumption and expenditure.","Sample weights for the household data were computed as the inverse of the product of the selection of dwelling at the first stage and the selection of the household at the second stage, computed at the subcamp level. The household weights were adjusted for non-response at the subcamp level. As part of post-stratification, weights were scaled to the population totals in each subcamp. 
The household weight variable is called weight and is used with the HH data and the HHM data.","UNHCR (2021) UNHCR Kakuma Socioeconomic  Survey - Anonymized for Public Use.

Kenya,KEN,2020,Socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on refugees - Panel Study,296,DDI_UNHCR_KEN_2020_COVID_Panel_v1.0,UNHCR,UNHCR,N/A,"The World Bank and UNHCR in collaboration with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting the Kenya COVID-19 Rapid Response Phone Survey to track the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the recovery from it as well as other shocks to provide timely data to inform a targeted response. This dataset contains information from eight waves of the COVID-19 RRPS, which is part of a panel survey that targets refugee household and started in May 2020. The same households were interviewed every two months for five survey rounds, in the first year of data collection, and every four months thereafter, with interviews conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) techniques. The sample aims to be representative of the refugee and stateless population in Kenya. It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless. Waves 1-7 of this survey include information on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, transfers, health, and COVID-19 knowledge. Wave 8 focused on how households were exposed to shocks, in particular adverse weather shocks and the increase in the price of food and fuel, but also included parts of the previous modules on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, and subjective wellbeing.
The data is uploaded in three files. The first is the hh file, which contains household level information. The 'hhid', uniquely identifies all household.  The second is the adult level file, which contains data at the level of adult household members. Each adult in a household is uniquely identified by the 'adult_id'. The third file is the child level file, available only for waves 3-7, which contains information for every child in the household. Each child in a household is uniquely identified by the 'child_id'.
The duration of data collection and sample size for each completed wave was: 
Wave 1: May 14 to July 7, 2020; 1,328 refugee households 
Wave 2: July 16 to September 18, 2020; 1,699 refugee households 
Wave 3: September 28 to December 2, 2020; 1,487 refugee households 
Wave 4: January 15 to March 25, 2021; 1,376 refugee households 
Wave 5: March 29 to June 13, 2021; 1,562 refugee households
Wave 6: July 14 to November 3, 2021; 1,407 refugee households
Wave 7: November 15, 2021, to March 31, 2022; 1,281 refugee households

New questions were added on the exposure to idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, on food and fuel price increases and subjective wellbeing.",Vyxer,"The sample aims to be representative of the refugee and stateless population in Kenya. It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless, where sampling approaches differ across strata. For refugees in Kakuma and Kalobeyei, as well as for stateless people, recently conducted Socioeconomic Surveys (SES), were used as sampling frames. For the refugee population living in urban areas and the Dadaab camp, no such household survey data existed, and sampling frames were based on UNHCR's registration records (proGres), which include phone numbers. For Kakuma, Kalobeyei, Dadaab and urban refugees, a two-step sampling process was used. First, 1,000 individuals from each stratum were selected from the corresponding sampling frames. Each of these individuals received a text message to confirm that the registered phone was still active. In the second stage, implicitly stratifying by sex and age, the verified phone number lists were used to select the sample. Until wave 7 sampled households that were not reached in earlier waves were also contacted along with households that were interviewed before.  In wave 8 only households that had previously participated in the survey were contacted for interview. The “wave” variable represents in which wave the households were interviewed in.  For the stateless population, all the participants of the Shona socioeconomic survey (n=400) were included in the RRPS, because of limited sample size. The sampling frames for the refugee and Shona stateless communities are thus representative of households with active phone numbers registered with UNHCR.",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],"The questionnaire included 12  sections

Section 12: Conclusion","Sampling weights for the refugee and stateless samples were tailored to the respective sampling strategies. Kakuma and Kalobeyei sub-samples have used the baseline weights from the respective SES underlying the sampling frame to adjust for any differences in the sampling probabilities. Then, propensity score weighting based on the full population covered in the SES household survey, have been used to account for differences in the probability of owning a phone number. The estimated propensity score reflects the household probability to have a phone number registered by UNHCR. To mitigate the effect of outlier estimates, the mean propensity score is computed for each decile. The baseline weights are then multiplied with the inverse of the propensity score deciles. For the refugees living in Dadaab camp and urban areas, a cell weighting approach has been used. Thereby, the sample is split into sub-groups (cells) based on the gender and age group of household head. The weights were then scaled such that they reflect the proportion of each cell in the UNHCR registration data of all refugees living in the respective location. In the group of stateless people registered with UNHCR, each household has the same weight assigned, as their full population is called in this survey. Lastly, to ensure sampling weights have the correct proportions across strata, they have been scaled to match population totals as provided by the up to date UNHCR registration data. Variable: weight
The data is also weekly representative for all waves except for wave 8. The variable weight_weekly should be used for weekly representative estimates.
Panel Weights 
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals: 
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1 
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples 
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups 
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile 
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac 
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2) 
6. Apply post-stratification in the same way as for cross-sectional weights (step 2) Variable: weight_panel_w1_2
The balanced panel weights including waves 3, 4, 5, 6,7 and 8 were constructed using the same procedure.

The underlying principle behind the process is linked to accountability, as well as a commitment to improve the quality and relevance of support provided, and related services. Usually the surveys that form the basis of the assessment are conducted soon after the distribution of relief items is completed. Four PDMs on Non-Food Items (NFI) have been conducted since 2018. One in March 2018 covering the period from the beginning of the refugee influx in August/September 2017, and the second one in August 2018 covering distributions made during the monsoon season that year. A third PDM exercise covered the period from September 2018 up to March 2019. And a fourth one in November 2019 covered the period from April to November 2019. The current PDM survey and recommendations cover the period from November 2019 up to July 2020. This PDM exercise was initially planned in April 2020, however, it was delayed due to the lockdown imposed at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,166 households that had received NFIs from UNHCR took part in this PDM exercise. The findings from this report will be used in improving further upcoming distributions in 2020 and take into consideration lessons learned from COVID-19's impact on the distribution process. 
This fifth PDM survey and exercise covers the distribution of six types of NFI assistance provided through UNHCR and its partners in 2020.

Lebanon,LBN,2020,"Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon, 2020",286,NA,UNHCR,UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP,Curation team/UNHCR/microdata@unhcr.org/,"Nine years into the Syria conflict, Lebanon remains at the forefront of one of the worst humanitarian crises. The economic downturn, steep inflation, COVID-19 and finally the Beirut blast have pushed vulnerable communities in Lebanon - including Syrian refugees - to the brink, with thousands of families sinking further into poverty. 
The Government of Lebanon (GoL) estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million1 of the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled the conflict since 2011 (including 879,529 registered with UNHCR as of end of September 2020 ). The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains one of the largest concentration of refugees per capita in the world. 
The 2020 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) was the eighth annual survey assessing the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon to identify changes and trends in their vulnerabilities. Given the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon, most assessments and other activities requiring in person visits were either cancelled or postponed. Considering the prolonged socio-economic status in Lebanon and COVID-19, it was crucial to provide needs-based estimates on Syrian refugees in the country. Thus, the VASyR 2020 was one of the few assessments that were conducted face-to-face; the implementation was accompanied by a comprehensive protocol to ensure the safety of families and field workers. The criticality of conducting the VASyR 2020 was to provide insights about Syrian refugees impacted by the political and economic crisis that hit Lebanon in late 2019 and by the COVID-19 outbreak.",2020-08-19-2020-09-1,Household and individual,National,Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

- education",Caritas,"Sampling for the VASyR follows a two-stage cluster approach, keeping with the methodology of previous years. UNHCR database of known Syrian refugees as of June 2020 served as the sample frame. Cases with missing addresses were excluded. Sampling was based on a ""30 x 7"" two-stage cluster scheme initially developed by the World Health Organization. This method outlines a sample size of 30 clusters per geographical area and seven households per cluster which provides a precision of +/- 10 percentage points. Districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure similar representativeness with other governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each, yielding 90 cluster selections for each. The governorate of Baalbek Hermel is made up of only two districts, as such, and to ensure an adequate sample in that governorate, one additional cluster sample was considered.

The primary sampling unit was defined as the village level (i.e. cluster) and UNHCR cases served as the secondary sampling unit. A case was defined as a group of people who are identified together as one unit (usually immediate family/household) under UNHCR databases. Using Emergency Nutrition Assesment (ENA) software, villages were selected using probability proportionate to size where villages with a larger concentration of refugees was more likely to be selected and 30 clusters/villages were selected with four replacement clusters, per district. 

In order to estimate the sample size needed to generate results that are representative on a district, governorate and national level, the following assumptions were used: 
- 50% estimated prevalence
- 10% precision
- 1.5 design effect 
- 5% margin of error

Using the above parameters, 165 cases per district/cluster selection was required, leading to a target of 5,115 cases nationally. Due to the known high level of mobility of the Syrian refugee population and based on experience in previous rounds of VASyR and other household level surveys, a 40% non-response rate was considered.",Face-to-face,"The 2020 VASyR questionnaire consisted of around 580 questions that collected data at the household level and individual level including demographics, legal documentation, safety and security, shelter, WASH, health, food security, livelihoods, expenditures, food consumption, debt, coping strategies and assistance, as well as questions specifically relating to women, children and people with disabilities.","Data collected through this assessment was weighted at the district level based on the population of refugees in each district.

In November 2017, the World Food Programme (WFP) joined the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in the delivery of multi-purpose cash (MPC) to assist the most economically vulnerable Syrian refugee households to meet their basic needs. 

This study aims to measure the short-term (12 months or less) and long-term (more than 12 months) causal impact of the $173.50 and $175 MPC assistance provided by WFP and UNHCR respectively, over and above the $27 per person per month assistance, as well as the impact of discontinuation from MPC on the well-being of Syrian refugees. This report presents the causal impact on multiple dimensions of well-being, namely household expenditures, food security, housing, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education, employment, health and decision-making. 

The key take-away messages from the study are: 
1. The impact of MPC materialised across most dimensions of well-being in the long-term, indicating the importance of households' access to a longer duration of MPC.
2. The benefits of MPC fade for many indicators within 4 to 10 months after discontinuation, and households' well-being returned to pre-assistance levels for most indicators, and dropped slightly below the pre-assistance baseline for others. 
3. The findings would suggest that there are benefits to instituting longer cash cycles and/or linking MPC to other services through a 'cash plus' approach to expand and extend the positive impact of cash on beneficiary households and ensure sustainable impact. 

A total of 11,457 households were visited and used in this analysis, which constitutes one of the largest samples among impact evaluations conducted in Lebanon to date.",2018-07-23-2019-09-0,Household and individual.,"Bekaa, North, and Mount Lebanon",Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope includes:

The impact evaluation used a quasi-experimental fuzzy regression discontinuity design, which enables estimation of the causal impact of MPC after different enrolment periods in the programme (rather than producing simple correlations). For this purpose, a multi-sectoral household survey was collected across three regions in Lebanon (Bekaa, North, and Mount Lebanon), where 85 per cent of Syrian refugees and 94 per cent of MPC beneficiaries live, over three waves of data collection held in July/ August 2018, February/March 2019, and July/August 2019. The multiple rounds of data collection allowed for the measurement of effects that materialise at different points in time and enabled the validation of the detected impact. Furthermore, collecting data in the summer and winter made it possible to account for seasonal variations, and accessing administrative data from UNHCR on other assistance programmes targeting the population of interest made it possible to append this information and distinguish between the effect of MPC and other programmes. WFP and UNHCR cash assistance beneficiaries are selected based on a proxy means testing formula that constructs a vulnerability score for each household based on a set of socio-demographic characteristics from the UNHCR database. This score predicts the per capita expenditure level of households and is used to rank them from most to least vulnerable. All households with a score below the SMEB are eligible for MPC. However, due to budgetary constraints, only about 29 per cent of eligible households currently receive the MPC package. WFP follows a bottom-up approach by including in the programme households starting from the lowest scores and moving up the scores until the allocated funding is fully disbursed. UNHCR employs a geographical bottomup targeting approach by including the most vulnerable households in each geographic region until it reaches the regions allocated proportion given its budget constraints. Accordingly, the point at which the funding is fully disbursed creates an artificial cut-off line. This creates a quasi-natural experiment where households on either side of the cut-off are plausibly similar along observable and unobservable characteristics. As a result, the argument is that the only difference is the receipt of MPC. Thus, any differences in outcomes between households are attributable to the amount of cash assistance received, which allows for measuring the causal impact of the MPC. Notably, because the annual recalibration of the targeting formula that determines a households eligibility for MPC occurred prior to the collection of wave 2 data, this uniquely positioned the study to measure the impact of discontinuation on affected household.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaire included the following sections: demographics, education, employment, health, food, housing, economic situation, accountability.",NA,"Please cite as follows:

Most of them were Shona, descendants of missionaries who arrived from Zimbabwe and Zambia in the 1960s and remained in Kenya. The total number of Shona living in Kenya is estimated to be between 3,000 and 3,500 people. 
On their first arrival, the Shona were issued certificates of registration, but a change in the Registration of Persons Act of 1978 did not make provision for people of non-Kenyan descent, consequently denying the Shona citizenship. Zimbabwe and Zambia did not consider them nationals either, rendering them stateless. Besides the Shona, there are other groups of stateless persons of different origins and ethnicities, with the total number of stateless persons in Kenya estimated at 18,500.
UNHCR and the Government of Kenya are taking steps to address statelessness in the country, among them is the registration of selected groups for nationalization. In April 2019, the Government of Kenya pledged to recognize qualifying members of the Shona community as Kenyan citizens. However, the lack of detailed information on the stateless population in Kenya hinders advocacy for the regularization of their nationality status. Together with the Kenyan Government through the Department of Immigration Services (DIS) and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), UNHCR Kenya conducted registration and socioeconomic survey for the Shona community from May to July 2019. While the primary objective of the registration was to document migration, residence and family history with the aim of preparing their registration as citizens, this survey was conducted to provide a baseline on the socio-economic situation of the stateless Shona population for comparison with non-stateless populations of Kenya.",2019-05-27-2019-07-0,Household and individual,"Githurai, Nairobi, Kiambaa and Kinoo",Census/enumeration data [cen],"The survey included a range of socio-economic indicators, both at the household and individual household member levels, aligned with the national 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) and forthcoming Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS).

Two principle methods were used to collect primary data: household questionnaire and documents review in a summative evaluation approach. 

The survey adopted a summative evaluation approach and a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods were used to obtain answers to the survey questions. The mixed approach was adopted for purposes of complementary, triangulation, and validation of responses. Primary data was collected with the use of household questionnaires, Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and review of existing literatures and reports. The inclusive criteria of the survey allowed the enumerators to collect data from household heads or any household member of age 18 years and above who consented to participate in the survey. Qualitative methods mainly KIIs were also adopted in order to gather an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of the various primary targets of the programme. These included households, members of WASH Committees, NRC staff and staff from the implementing partner agencies. Observation method was also used during the survey to assess WASH infrastructure and human habits. The infrastructure included; water points, sanitation and hygiene facilities. 

The stratified random sampling survey was carried out in in the 4 camps of Kakuma and the 3 villages of Kalobeyei. In Kakuma, all the 13 zones were included in the study for significant representation. The study population comprised all the households for the 192,352 refugees and asylum seekers registered in Kakuma camp (153,593) and Kalobeyei settlement (36,099) as per UNHCR population statistics of August 2019.

The burden of collecting firewood also disproportionately affects women and children, who have to travel considerable distances from their homes in order to provide the necessary fuel for cooking, exposing themselves to increased risks of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV). It is from these concerns that UNHCR and partners in Kigoma Region embarked on a pilot programme to provide the PoCs with alternative cooking energy as well as launching energy saving initiatives in Nyarugusu, Nduta and Mtendeli Refugee Camps. DRC, GNTZ, REDESO, CEMDO and UNHCR were involved in the implementation of this programme which had three main components, namely, Charcoal Briquettes and LPG Comparative analysis at Nduta; manufacturing of charcoal briquettes at Nyarugusu; and community-based training on energy saving practices and SGBV awareness raising in Nduta, Mtendeli and Nyarugusu camps.",2019-03-22-2019-03-2,Household,Kigoma Region,Sample survey data [ssd],Household,UNHCR,"A total of 1,200 PoCs participants were involved in this project in which 400 of them received

It was conducted in the two counties of Kilifi and Kwale on the coast, north and south of Mombasa, respectively. According to information from village elders familiar with the Pemba community in Kenya, most of the Pemba population resides in these two counties. While there are some Pemba residents in Lamu, the security situation prevented data collection there. Further, a few Pemba are believed to live in the city of Mombasa and elsewhere in the country. But due to lack of further information, no data were collected in Mombasa or elsewhere. 
The objectives of the full survey, conducted in August 2016, were:
1.	To establish the number and characteristics of the Pemba living in Kenya, including their arrival period in Kenya, nationality and their problems; 
2.	To make recommendations for the issuance of the documentation that is required for those who apply for citizenshiop by registration",2016-08-22-2016-08-2,"Households, individuals","Kwale and Kilifi counties, Kenya.",Census/enumeration data [cen],"Individuals: Demographics and citizenship status.
Household: Demographics and ownership of personal documents",UNHCR,"A household mapping exercise was conducted in Kilifi and Kwale to identify Pemba households and to make it easier to locate them on the ground. The mapping was done from 4 to 12 August 2016 by a team from UNHCR Kenya office and KNBS. 
The mapping in each village commenced with a visit to the chief's office, who put the team in touch with the village chair. The team explained the purpose of its visit to the village chair and began the mapping exercise. The importance of involving the chiefs and village chairpersons is that they are well connected, recognised and trusted by residents in their communities. The same procedure is followed by KNBS when they are mapping for sample surveys and censuses.
The team established physical boundaries of the area to be mapped, located the boundaries on the map and then identified and listed the Pemba households within the enumeration boundary.  A Pemba household, in this context, is one identified by the informants as having at least one person with origins or links to Pemba. The links may include a person's spouse, parents or grandparents, who migrated to Kenya from Pemba or where a person has migrated from Pemba to Kenya. 
The mapping team was followed by the village chair to the Pemba households, where the UNHCR and Haki Centre staff listed number of persons in each, while the KNBS staff marked the location of the household on the map. The entrances of identified Pemba households were marked in chalk with the letters HCR and a number starting at 001 to make it easier to find the houses during the enumeration. Since it seems to be generally well known where the Pemba live it was not considered stigmatising to mark their doors. During the feedback forums with the Pemba after the survey, there was no mention of stigmatization due to marking the door with chalk. 
The maps were from the 2009 national housing and population census, purchased from KNBS. The team made lists with information about the location, number and size of each household. The mapping team visited 17 villages in Kilifi and Kwale (see Table 1 in Section 2.7). All villages visited were identified before the mapping exercise by key informants as locations being home to the Pemba of Kenya. The key informants were Pemba elders in different sub-counties previously identified for providing background information on the Pemba arrival and history in Kenya. In each sub-country, the chief, the assistant chief or the village chair also accompanied the team. In Kwale, 358 households were identified with 2,220 persons, and in Kilifi, 86 households with 558 persons.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaire was developed before the pilot survey and revised during and after the pilot survey, based on the experience gained. The pilot survey was used to test the questions and to check for inconsistences and misinterpretations due to unclear concepts and definitions. The testing process also revealed some important themes that had been left out.
The structure of the questionnaire was altered, including the order of the questions and the introductory pages, to facilitate administration of the questionnaire.
Finally, the questionnaire was translated into Swahili. Both the English and Swahili versions were used in the survey, even though the English version was preferred by almost all interviewers. The two versions of the questionnaire are attached in Annex 4 and 5.

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites, and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey was designed to address these shortcomings and support the settlement's development framework, as well as the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Two socio-economic questionnaires were administered - the Basic and the Extended Questionnaires. While all households received the Basic questionnaire, 18.5 percent among them were randomly sampled for the extended questionnaire. 

The scope of the questionnaire includes:
- Education (Basic and Extended)
- Employment (Basic and Extended)
- Household Characteristics (Basic and Extended)
- Asset (Basic and Extended)
-Access to Services (Extended)
- Vulnerability, Social Cohesion and Coping (Extended)

Data collection occurred concurrently with a UNHCR registration verification exercise. Registration records were updated for all households in the settlement. A systematic random sample was then selected for an extended SEP interview. Those who were not selected for the extended interview were administered a shorter, basic version of the questionnaire. For this survey, a stratified single-stage sample design was applied. The sample was implicitly stratified for the three villages in the settlement. For the Basic SEP, all households in the settlement are selected and the selection probability is 1. For the Extended SEP, a targeted sample size of 1500 households was required to obtain a 15 percent difference in the poverty rates of 2 groups in the sample at a confidence level of 95 percent and a power of 80 percent. To randomly select these households, a straight forward approach was used to select these households from registered proGres families before the exercise. Thus, households that received the extended SEP were randomly determined before the start of the survey using the tablet. The sample of the extended survey alone is representative and therefore sufficient for generating poverty estimates headline indicators for the population as a whole.

The report also incorporates findings on needs among refugee and host community populations living in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The findings and analysis from this report has been used to support the Refugee Response Plan for 2019-2020, along with informing other programmatic, strategic, and operational decision making for the humanitarian response coordinators and partner organisations. The JMSNA aims to compare humanitarian needs across population groups and locations in order to highlight groups and areas of most concern. Consequently, it aims to answer the following research question: what is the situation for specific population groups (refugees residing within refugee settlements and host community populations) in Uganda regarding health and nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); livelihoods, environment and energy; shelter, site planning, and non-food items; education; and food security.

The JMSNA process in Uganda began in February 2018, with REACH facilitating the research design under the auspices of UNHCR and Uganda’s Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). Through the inter-agency coordination group and other coordination mechanisms, a collaborative tool was developed with input from many partners. Data collection was conducted from 2 April to 14 July, 2018, in all 30 refugee settlements. Data collection was carried out in Kampala from 6 to 16 March and 28 March to 9 April to assess the needs of refugee and host community households in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

Two surveys were conducted in Nyarugusu refugee camp to allow comparison among the old population predominantly from the Democratic Republic of Congo and the new arrivals mostly the Burundians and Congolese who arrived in the camp as from May 2015. 

The main objective of the 2016 nutrition survey was to determine the health and nutrition status among children 6-59 months living in the refugee camps. Additional indicators on child health such as immunization, vitamin A supplementation, incidence of diarrhoea in the past two weeks, infant and young child feeding practices (IYCF) and anaemia prevalence among children aged 6- 59 months and non -pregnant women aged 15 - 59 years, household food security, WASH, Mosquito net coverage and mortality were also assessed.

The peace agreement and the Darfur Development Strategy (DDS) that followed constitute political commitments to support durable peace and development in Darfur. This pledge has resulted in piloting a durable solutions process in El Fasher in North Darfur.
To reach durable solutions and end displacement, long-term planning based on agreed and jointly-owned comprehensive data is needed. To establish an agreed evidence base, a collaborative profiling approach was adopted that brought actors together to ensure trust and ownership of the results of the profiling exercise. An important aspect of this durable solutions profiling is that it places IDPs centre-stage alongside the two other major stakeholdersthe Government of Sudan and the international communitypermitting the profiling results and recommendations to be owned and signed off by all parties. The durable solutions profiling exercise in El Fasher makes up step two: getting better informed about the displacement affected communities in the five-stage durable solutions process.

The four strata were divided into clusters of similar population size, based on a grid developed on a map of the areas. Clusters were selected from each stratum with a uniform probability of selection. The sampling was conducted in this manner, because there was no reliable population data available which would have made sampling probabilities to size possible. All the households in the selected enumeration areas were listed, while 12 were selected for interviews in each cluster in simple random draws. The listing exercise resulted in a significantly lower number of clusters than was planned. To compensate for the lower number of clusters, some of the listed clusters were selected for oversampling.

Despite facing its own economic challenges, for decades Tanzania has welcomed thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring countries of Great Lakes Region. The counties geographic proximity to the strife-torn Congo Basin is responsible in part for the ease access of displaced populations. As well Tanzania was an early signatory in the region to international agreements on the rights and welfare of refugee and asylum seekers.
 
As of December, 2018, Tanzania host some 284,300 camp-based refugees, 77% of who are children and woman, in Nduta, Nyarugusu and Mtendeli Refugee Camps in Kigoma region in Northwest Tanzania. About 74% are from Burundi, and the remaining 26% are primarily from Democratic republic of Congo. 

Following a Tripartite Commission meeting in August 2017, the governments of Tanzania, Burundi, and UNHCR agreed to assist refugees who wish to voluntarily repatriate from Tanzania to Burundi. A subsequent meeting in March 2018 reaffirmed the commitment of both governments and UNHCR to uphold the principle of voluntariness, and noted that while some refugees may opt to return, others will continue to be in need of international protection. The March 2018 Tripartite meeting also produced a work plan entailing the repatriation of approximately 2,000 refugees per week from 5 April to 31 December 2018.

Currently there are three refugee camps namely Nyarugusu (comprising of Old and New Camps) located in Kasulu, Nduta in Kibondo district and Mtendeli in Kakonko district. 
The oldest refugee camp is Nyarugusu which has been hosting refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi since 1996. Refugees from Burundi were repatriated voluntarily in 2012 leading to closure of some of the existing camps. The remainder population in need of protection were relocated to Nyarugusu camp where the total population then was about 65,000 as of early April 2015 majority being Congolese refugees and other minority nationalities such as Rwandese, Sudanese, Ugandans, and Kenyans. 

The refugee situation changed in 2015 following the political instability after the general elections in Burundi leading exodus of some Burundians to Tanzania and other neighbouring countries. As from late April 2015 higher numbers of refugees from Burundi started arriving in Tanzania mainly through a tiny border village along Lake Tanganyika and other entry points in Kigoma region. After the influx, the total population increased causing congestion in Nyarugusu camp calling for the re-opening two camps; Nduta camp on the 7th October 2015 and Mtendeli camp on 14th January 2016. 
Nyarugusu currently hosts Congolese refugees (Old Camp) and 39.4% of the Burundi refugees (New Camp) who arrived at the onset of the emergency. Nduta hosts an estimated population of 123,673 refugees who were relocated from Nyarugusu and Mtendeli hosts 52,004 who were relocated from Nyarugusu and is still receiving the new arrivals.

There are over 2.2 million refugees spread across Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the Central African Republic (CAR) a further 1.8 million people are displaced internally in South Sudan. An estimated 140,000 South Sudanese spontaneously returnees are reported to have returned to South Sudan from November 2018 to date.

The South Sudan situation continues to be characterized as a children's tragedy with children constituting over 65 percent of the refugee population. The Revitalised Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) foresees the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU) with all the parties in agreement including the leader of the SPLA IO and first vice president by May 2019.

In November 2018, it was agreed during the Kampala Representatives meeting that intention surveys should be conducted for South Sudanese refugees in all countries of asylum. This was further concretized in March 2019, during the EHA/GLR planning meeting; here it was decided that UNHCR country representations of CAR, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Sudan, Ethiopia would ensure that a rapid intention survey of South Sudanese refugees in their respective asylum countries is carried out before May 2019, in line with the agreed calendar of the R-ARCSS

The Intention Survey was a cross-sectional survey conducted among the over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees living in six countries of asylum using a stratified random sampling approach to survey 6,964 refugees (heads of households) in 15 camps selected across the region. In each location, sample size estimation assumed a 95 per cent confidence level, and a margin of error of 7 per cent; sample was drawn taking into account the location, place of origin, ethnicity, year of arrival to the country of asylum and gender of the head of household. The confidence intervals were taken into consideration in all the tables and analysis. Security, access and logistical constraints restricted sampling in some locations, therefore weighting was applied to adjust for unequal selection probabilities in each of the 15 locations. The findings of this report are representative of the return intentions of refugee households in these 15 camps. Data was collected through in-person interviews using a harmonised survey that was conducted concurrently in the six countries in May 2019 with a mobile data collection tool (KoBo Toolkit).

In each location, sample size estimation assumed a 95 per cent confidence level, and a margin of error of 7 per cent; sample was drawn taking into account the location, place of origin, ethnicity, year of arrival to the country of asylum and gender of the head of household. The confidence intervals were taken into consideration in all the tables and analysis. Security, access and logistical constraints restricted sampling in some locations, therefore weighting was applied to adjust for unequal selection probabilities in each of the 15 locations. The findings of this report are representative of the return intentions of refugee households in these 15 camps. Data was collected through in-person interviews using a harmonised survey that was conducted concurrently in the six countries in May 2019 with a mobile data collection tool (KoBo Toolkit).

By end of August 2018, UNHCR distributed 93,803 Core Relief Item (CRI) packages to newly arrived refugee families, each containing tarpaulins, kitchen set, blanket, jerry can, bucket, sleeping mat and solar lamp. At the same time, 90,524 families received Upgrade Shelter Kit (USK) consisting of mulli and borak bamboos, rope, plastic tarpaulins, sandbags and toolkits, to reinforce their shelters for the monsoon season. UNHCR, in close collaboration with partner agencies and other humanitarian actors, continues to support the Government of Bangladesh in responding to the refugee crisis by ensuring relief items are prepositioned and delivered to the most vulnerable refugees and host communities in a timely manner.
UNHCR uses Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) as a mechanism to collect refugee’s feedback on the quality, sufficiency, utilisation and effectiveness of assistance received. It is conducted after the distribution of relief items is completed. A total of 2,298 households were interviewed in this PDM. The PDM survey confirmed that non-food packages distributed by UNHCR and partners met the household needs and minimum quality standard as agreed by the Shelter/NFI Sector in Cox’s Bazar. The overall satisfaction score has improved from the previous survey in March. The refugees reported high satisfaction for the items received, and rated above 4.1 on a 5-point Likert scale for the items quality and usefulness. They also reported general satisfaction with the organisation of NFI distribution, with an average score of 4.0 on the Likert scale. The finding shows that UNHCR and partners are fulfilling their commitment to provide relief items that meet the specific needs of refugees, and that they were distributed in a timely and efficient manner.",2018-08-29-2018-09-0,Household.,Cox's Bazar refugee camps.,NA,"The scope includes:

Presently, there are limits on how self-sufficient refugees can be, as they have restricted freedom of movement beyond the areas where the settlements are and also have no right to work. In addition, there is insufficient land within their settlements to support subsistence farming. As a result, many refugees are unable to access cash independently to support themselves, and many struggle for the basic necessities not already covered by humanitarian assistance. All current assistance in the form of in-kind distributions and services are free of charge. This includes, for example, food, shelter materials, household items and health services. A number of cash-for-work schemes were designed to support and manage some of the basic services and works in the camps; however, to date, they have not created sufficient income opportunities for refugees or host communities. Likewise, our teams have confirmed that some humanitarian aid items are being sold at local markets. This shows refugees are adopting other, and potentially harmful, coping mechanisms to generate cash for their needs that are not, or not fully, covered by current humanitarian assistance. Negative coping strategies such as food borrowing, reduction in the number of meals and reduced consumption of preferred foods are witnessed across the entire Rohingya refugee population. Between April and May 2018, UNHCR piloted the delivery of unconditional and unrestricted Multipurpose Cash Grants (MPGs) to cover unmet basic needs. This extended to all residents of Camp 5 and Camp 6 in the Kutupalong refugee settlement and was equivalent to approximately half of the monthly Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) for a family of five.
After completing the delivery of the grants, UNHCR conducted a detailed Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey (320 households were interviewed). A Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) survey is a mechanism to collect and understand refugees’ feedback on the assistance provided by humanitarian agencies like UNHCR. PDMs are widely used by UNHCR and help to evaluate the effectiveness of the assistance provided directly by UNHCR or through its partners. A PDM is conducted independently from the distribution exercise itself, but closely following it in time. This PDM was intended to evaluate the adequacy of the cash grant provided as well as patterns in its use. It also sought to identify challenges and constraints experienced, and seek refugees’ feedback on any improvements required to implement similar assistance again in the future.
The PDM supports a hypothesis that the current basic in-kind assistance packages provided to refugees are not sufficient to meet all demonstrated needs, with the result that potentially harmful coping mechanisms like selling assistance are employed. The adoption of this cash programme by UNHCR, therefore, seeks to ensure that refugees can address their multiple needs in accordance with their household and personal priorities, including benefits such as greater access to a more diversified diet, better hygiene or shelter improvements.",2018-05-14-2018-05-2,Household.,Camp 5 and Camp 6 in the Kutupalong refugee settlement.,NA,"The scope includes:

Since August 2017, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya refugees have arrived in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, increasing the total number of Rohingya refugees to more than 900,000.
Most of the newly-arrived refugees have settled in hilly, formerly-forested areas that are vulnerable to landslides and flash-flooding in monsoon season and rely heavily on humanitarian assistance to cover their basic needs. As the crisis moves beyond the initial emergency phase, comprehensive information on the needs and vulnerabilities of affected populations is needed in order to inform the design and implementation of effective inter-sectoral programming. To this aim, a Joint Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (J-MSNA) was conducted across Rohingya refugee populations to support humanitarian planning and enhance operational and strategic decision-making. The J-MSNA was conducted in support of the mid-term review of the 2019 Joint Response Plan (JRP), with the specific objective of enabling the tracking of JRP 2019 indicators for monitoring and review purposes.

Now in its sixth year, the Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) assesses a representative sample of Syrian refugee families to identify changes and trends in their situation. The Government of Lebanon estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees who have fled their country’s conflict since 2011 (including nearly one million registered with UNHCR as of end of September 2018).  The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains the largest concentration of refugees per capita and the fourth largest refugee population in the world. VASyR includes a sample of 4,446 Syrian refugee households from 26 districts across Lebanon. The assessment demonstrates that despite the large scale assistance and the efforts of Lebanon and its partners that have resulted in improvements in economic vulnerability and stabilization in education, food security and some improvements in the situation for women, girls and female-headed households, Syrian refugees still remain very vulnerable.

Using the ""30x7"" two stage cluster scheme, originally developed by the World Health Organization, 30 clusters per geographical area and seven households per cluster are used to provide a precision of +/- 10 percentage points. The sampling strategy accounted for the need to generate results that are representative on a district, governorate and national level. As such, districts were considered as the geographical level within which 30 clusters were selected. There are 26 districts in Lebanon, where Beirut and Akkar each represent a district and a governorate. As such, to ensure representativeness of these two districts as governorates, an additional two cluster samples were considered for each.
The primary sampling unit was defined as the village level (i.e. cluster) and UNHCR cases served as the secondary sampling unit. A case was defined as a group of people who are identified together as one unit (usually immediate family) under UNHCR databases. Villages were selected using 'probability proportionate to size,' and 30 clusters/villages were selected with four replacement clusters per district.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaire included key information on household demographics, arrival profile, registration, protection, shelter, WASH, assets, health, education, security, livelihoods, expenditures, food consumption, coping strategies, debts and assistance, as well as infant and young feeding practices.","Data collected through this assessment was weighted at the district level based on the population of refugees in each district.

With the attacks of the Nigerian towns of Bosso and Diffa by the Boko Haram in February 2015, the islands of Lake Chad and villages along the Komadougou (Nigeria border), the phenomena have worsened, increasing the population's displacements inside the Diffa region itself. 
These newly displaced populations have been added to the previously affected groups. The situation for the period of November 2016 shows that approximately 302,407 displaced persons live in the Diffa region including refugees (88,688), returnees (29,315) and internally displaced persons (184404). This situation prompted authorities to allow the opening of the Sayam Forage refugee camp, with 12,000 refugees and returnees from Nigeria. 
To prevent the spread of hygiene and sanitation-related diseases in these camps, Action Pour le Bien-Etre (APBE), financially supported by UNHCR, conducted WASH activities on this camp. A KAP (knowledge, attitudes and practices) survey was conducted in August 2018 (266 households were interviewed).

In terms of access to protection services, only a small number of households report members making use of children and women friendly spaces. Despite widespread distribution coverage of key non-food items such as kitchen sets, demand for these items remains high, and refugees are spending the greatest portion of their limited financial resources on basic items including food, clothing and fuel.

The sample design for the study was multi-stage with the first stage covering the primary sampling units (PSUs) which was a sample of clusters developed during the 1999 census. The second stage was selection of households within the clusters. A re-listing of all households in sampled clusters was carried out to up-date the 1999 and also to be able to classify households into the three strata of interest in this study: international migrant households, internal migrant households, and non-migrant households. At the household level, interviews were held with the household head/spouse or other responsible adult with the requisite information about the household. 
The study uses a purposive survey methodology that first selected districts with the largest concentration of international migrants, and then selected clusters also with the highest concentration of international migrants. This was done based on the information of previous household surveys and the knowledge of the administrative officers, statistical officers and cluster guides. 

Sampling Frame
At the time of the study, the available National Census was conducted in 1999. This census did not contain questions on remittances but had questions on migration.  The migration question asked then was where family members were living in the last one year.  This means that the census captured either those who had come back or those who had come visiting and were to return to where they migrated to.  It did not distinguish clearly the migration component.  Further, the census was conducted 10 years ago which meant it does not provide the current status on aspects of migration. The Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) 2005/06 and the Financial Services Deepening survey (FSD) are two surveys that have recently been conducted with an element of migration and remittances.  However, the information is not adequate for the current survey.  For example, the KIHBS has a question that captures issues of remittance linking them to the transfers received from abroad.  Although it has about 13,000 households, only about 125 households indicated they had received such transfers.  This was a very small sample compared to what was envisaged by the current study.  The Financial Services Deepening survey (FSD) (2006/07) also has a question on cash transfers from abroad but all this is related to issues of access to financial services and not to issues sought in the current study.  Thus, it could not be used for the current study.  The KIHBS and FSD surveys was based on the KNBS NASSEP IV and although one may have thought of revisiting the households that were covered for additional information, it is against the KNBS regulations to conduct such follow-ups and the households identities are not provided.
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics household survey sampling frame, the National Sample Survey and Evaluation Programme (NASSEP IV), is based on the 1999 population and housing census.  The objective of NASSEP IV frame was to construct a national master sampling frame of clusters of households in both rural and urban areas in Kenya using a sound sampling design.  This sampling frame has a total of 1,800 clusters of which 1,260 are rural and 540 are urban as indicated in Appendix Table 1.  Each cluster holds about 80 to 100 households.  The framework is based on the old administrative units comprising of 69 districts in 8 Provinces.  Currently, the districts have been subdivided and increased to 265 but this does not distort our sampling frame based on NASSEP IV as the new districts are curved out of the old districts.

The Sample
This study utilized the NASSEP IV frame to select 102 clusters (5.6% of the total clusters) in 19 districts which yielded a total sample of 2,448 households assuming an average of 24 households in each cluster.  The districts were selected first, then the clusters in each district and finally the households in each cluster.  Households in each cluster were re-listed (updated) and grouped into three strata--international migrant, internal migrant and non-migrant households.  In the selection of clusters in each district, at least one of the targeted five clusters was urban with exception of Nairobi and Mombasa which are purely urban.
The study however ended up covering 92 clusters (5.1% of the total clusters in NASSEP IV) from 17 districts. Two targeted districts-Kajiado and Baringo- were not covered due to logistical problems.  First of all, the team was expected to finalize the field by 15th December so that the analysis could begin and be on time.  When the fieldwork was winding up on 22nd December, the two districts were yet to be covered.  Two, the two districts have more transport challenges and the team was therefore expected to use KNBS transport facilities and more research assistants to capture the households which are more widely spread on the ground.  This required adequate funding and by the time the fieldwork was winding up no funds had been received from World Bank.  Third, even when the funds were received in January, the team considered that the study would be capturing households in a different consumption cycle, having just gone through the festive season.  Given all these factors, this saw a total of 2,123 household covered out of 2, 208 (96% of the total targeted). Of these, some households were later dropped due to a lot of missing data especially due to non response, and at the end a total of 1,942 households were cleaned up for analysis. This including 953 are urban and 989 rural drawn from 51 rural and 40 urban clusters.
Selection of Districts
There was a particular interest in investigating households that had international migrants and which may have received transfers from abroad. A random sample of the population would not produce adequate number of households that had received transfers or had international migration, as we learnt from the KIHBS data set.  As indicated earlier, out of 13,000 households surveyed under KIHBS only 125 households receiving remittances from abroad.  With this experience and information, this study selected the top nineteen districts from KIHBS (2005/07) that showed households with migration characteristics.  The key factor used was that the households indicated they received cash transfers from abroad. Districts with more than one household fulfilling this criterion of having received transfers from abroad were considered. In addition, Financial Services Deepening survey (FSD) survey results were used to confirm that the selected districts had reported having received money from abroad.  In addition, since this is a relatively rare phenomenon in Kenya, the selection of districts is designed such that households with the relevant characteristics have a high probability of being selected. As such those districts with a presence of cash transfers mechanisms such as M-PESA, Western Union, or Money Gram services were considered.  All these information was used to update the information from KIHBS. 

Selection of Clusters
In each district, 5 clusters were selected of which at least one cluster was an urban cluster as defined by KNBS, except for Nairobi and Mombasa which are purely urban.  Some other district had more than one urban cluster selected based on their number of clusters and accessibility to rural clusters for example Garissa.  The study covered 10 clusters in Nairobi and 6 in Mombasa with an attempt made to capture this across various income group levels.  
In selection of the clusters, the supervisors sat down with the KNBS statistics officers, cluster guides, village elders, administrative officers (Chiefs and sub-chiefs) to map out clusters where the probability of getting an international migrant was high.  Of this probabilities were very subjective as it was based on how well these people understood the composition of the households in the areas they represent.  This helped to identify the five clusters targeted for study.

Selection of Households
The selection process involved re-listing of the households in each cluster so as to update the list of occupied households and identify the three groups of households.  Each group or stratum was treated as an independent sub-frame and random sampling was used to select households in each group.   The listing exercise was facilitated by the respective District Statistical Officer (DSO).  An instrument was developed to capture the basic characteristics of households in terms of household headship, number of members, and whether contain international or internal migrants and number.
A total of 24 households per cluster were targeted for selection for interview making a minimum of 120 households in each district except Mombasa and Nairobi.  Experience on the ground was different and this saw variations on the household selected in the sample.  The factors considered included availability of international migrants and a rule that in each cluster a maximum of 10 non-migrant households were surveyed (the expected rule was 10 non-migrants, 7 local migrants and 7 international migrant).  However due to the rarity of international migrants, in the sampling process, international migrants were given a priority so that in each cluster almost all were included in the sample.
In the re-listing exercise, households were assigned identification numbers.  When the number of households listed in a stratum exceeds the number to be sampled, households in that stratum were selected randomly.  However, the procedure results in unequal selection probabilities of households in the three strata, which needs to be kept track of through the supervisor sampling sheets.
For the identification of the respondent household and clusters, the NASSEP IV sampling frame had adequately documented facilitating identification of selected clusters and households on the ground.  Each cluster had a map and a listing of the households within it.  The maps indicate the location of the structures and the households.  This enabled the interviewers reach the selected household.",Face-to-face,"· Questionnaire was designed by the World Bank; updated and contextualized by the research team School of Economics University of Nairobi
· Tested in a pilot survey conducted in Nairobi
· Language of design was English. Enumerators however came from the local areas covered in the survey and were trained to elicit information as contained in the questionnaire in local languages 

The survey questionnaire has 7 sections. Every question is important, and should be completed as fully and accurately as possible.  The goal is to collect the BEST possible information from household respondents on each and every question.  All answers are to be recorded on the actual survey questionnaire.  Each household member is assigned an ID and this ID remains the same throughout the questionnaire.  In other words, the ID of a household member does NOT change from one section of the questionnaire to another. 

COVER SHEET
The cover sheet asks for basic information on the household, such as location of household, name of household head, village/town and enumeration area.  It is very important to fill this cover sheet out correctly, so that – if some information is incorrect - the household can be located again.  

SECTION 1:  HOUSEHOLD ROSTER
This section collects basic demographic data on each and every member of the household. It is VERY important that this section be completed accurately and completely.  

SECTION 2:  HOUSEHOLD CONDITIONS
Section 2 collects information on household conditions and characteristics. Please interview the main person responsible for each dwelling.  In this section there is only one response for each household.   The Q2.1 asks for the tenure status of the dwelling whereas Q2.2 and Q2.3 ask about its construction and the material of its exterior walls. Information on cooking room and the total number of rooms are in Q2.4 and Q2.5. The last questions in this section ask about the presence of electricity and the source of drinking water for the household.

SECTION 3:  HOUSEHOLD ASSETS AND EXPENDITURE
Section 3 is VERY important because it collects information on the assets and expenditures of the household. The goal of this section is to understand the current welfare status of the household, that is, is the household rich or poor.  

SECTION 4: USE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES
Section 4 collects information on the household use of financial services. The purpose of this section is to see if households with migrants and remittances tend to use banks more often than households without migrants. 

SECTION 5: MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES FROM FORMER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS
Section 5 collects information on internal and international migration and remittances from former household members who are currently living outside of the household.  “Former household members” here means any person who used to live in the household, but is CURRENTLY living away from the household in another place within the country OR in another country.  The person who is CURRENTLY living outside the household may have moved away for the purposes of work, marriage, education, or other reason.  

SECTION 6: MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES FROM NON-HOUSEHOLD HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS
Section 6 collects information on internal and international remittances received from non-household members.  In other words, households without migrants may well receive remittances from friends, relatives and other people who are not members of their households. Households without migrants can also receive remittances from people for the repayment of loans or debts.

SECTION 7:  RETURN MIGRANTS
Section 7 collects information on household members who used to live in another part of the country OR in another country, and have since returned to the household to live.  For the purposes of this survey, these people are defined as “return migrants.”  “Return migrants” here include all members of the household who used to live outside of the household for at least 3 months during the last 5 years, and have since returned to the household to live.",NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

It has ensured an adequate representation of migration density in Burkina Faso. First we used the Burkina Faso Census 2006 that includes questions on demographic and migration. Then we calculated the incidence of international migration for each of the 45 provinces in Burkina Faso. We chose the largest 10 provinces which have the highest international migration incidence. The universe for this survey is the households that are placed in these provinces. After chosen the universe of households, we have adopted a two stages sampling: i) village/town sector and ii) household. Migration scope is different depending on the province or rural/urban area in Burkina Faso. We determine the number of village to be selected in each province according to the international migration incidence of each province. In total we selected 78 villages out of 2,273 villages for the 10 provinces.

Village town sector selection

The first stage of sampling consisted of villages and towns selection. We randomly selected the village/town sector within each province with equal probability. We have considered a village/town sector sample size of 27 households. We distributed the 27 households according to the following rule: 9 households with international migrants, 9 households with internal migrants and 9 households with no migrants. Thus, the whole sample is composed of 78 villages/towns sectors for 2,106 households. Considering migration density in each province, a number of villages/town sectors were randomly selected by province. In big town as Ouagadougou, each sector was considered as a village.

Household selection

The second sampling stage was household selection. Households were randomly selected after doing an exhaustive and quick household census in the selected village. For the villages in rural areas, we listed all the households in the village. The listing survey was not done for all households in town: we have randomly selected about 120 households in each selected town sector around a random start point. This number is extended if needed in order to attend the household type quotas. We have determined this point by using the town addressing codes. The process consisted of selecting randomly a street code and an avenue code which constituted the two elements of the start point. The main objective of the census is the household sampling. It provides information on the head household name, household size and household category (households without migrants, households with internal migrants and households with international migrants). The sub sample size for each household category is 9 in selected village/town sector. These households are randomly selected among the total households of the category from the quick census.",Face-to-face,8 section questionnaire designed in English by the World Bank Migration and Remittance Team with the collaboration of the survey implementation team staff. This questionnaire has been translated into French by the survey team staff and submitted to pre-test and pilot in area with similar migration and remittance characteristics to the survey zone.,"Following the sampling frame, weights are calculated at three levels: province, village and household. The province is weighted considering its population and the total population of the survey area (10 provinces). The village is weighted in the same way, according to its population, the total population of the corresponding province and the total population of the 10 provinces of the survey area. As households have been selected in three categories (households with no migrant, households with internal migrant and households with international migrant), the weight of each household is calculated taking into account the number of households in its category. It also includes the weights of its village and province. For any level, the weight is the inverse of the level unit selection probability. Further calculation details are in the STATA do-file programs while weights are in the database from the survey.
We have adopted a probabilistic two stage sampling method. It is necessary to correct the inequality in probability for the observed unit (household) to be selected in the survey universe. The standard correction method consists of weighting the statistic outcomes.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The 2002 population and housing census provided a frame for sample selection. The frame contains a list of all administrative units up to the lowest level called, 'Local Council 1', or LC1. This is usually, but not always consistent with a village in terms of area. The Enumeration Area (EA) may comprise of one village/LC1, or more than one village/LC1. The demarcation of EAs is based on total population within a given area and in many instances, may vary by locality. In addition the sampling frame also indicates the EA to which a particular LC belongs. The 2002 Uganda Sampling Frame has a total of 33,283 EAs. 

Study population

The study population comprised of the entire population of Uganda. Based on the distribution of households in table 1 above, the sample was determined based on information from Uganda National Household survey 2005/06 conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics.  The proportion of internal migrants reported in the past 5 years has been used to estimate the required sample. Given the limited nature of the number of international migrants, the proportion of internal migrants is considered adequate to provide sufficient estimates of the indicators of interest.

Sample allocation by region

The above sample was proportionately allocated across the four statistical regions on the basis of the population in each of the regions. There was oversampling for urban population approximately by 5 times. To ease implementation, the regional sample was further disaggregated down to Enumeration Area level. 

Selection of Enumeration Areas

The task was to undertake a nationally-representative survey of 2,000 households (urban and rural combined) in 2009 that would provide information on migration, remittances and their effects on development.
The frame was be divided into two strata namely rural and urban. A two-stage stratified sample design was adopted. The first stage representing the primary sampling unit comprised of the selection of EAs from each of the strata while at the second and ultimate stage households were selected. EAs were selected from the list of Enumeration Areas developed after the 2002 Population and Housing Census and updated to include new districts. 

The selection of EAs was proportionally done based on the number of households in the respective stratum according to the 2006 Uganda household survey. All the EAs in each domain were sorted by county, sub-county and parish. A random number was generated and an appropriate random start and sampling interval was systematically selected from the ordered list with probability proportionate to number of households.  This was done separately for urban and rural areas, hence stratified sampling.  The proportion of EAs sampled in urban areas is about 5 times that in rural.

Selection of households

At the second stage, a complete listing of households in each EA was done to classify the households into three groups: non migrants, internal migrants and international migrants. The number of households per EA varied from around 20 to about 1000. Most of the time, all households were listed even in the large EAs since it was difficult to establish lines of demarcation to segment the EA. 

A total of 10 households were selected randomly from each of the 200 EAs. The goal was to select 4 households with an international migrant (emigrant), 3 with one or more internal migrants, and 3 with no migrant. This sampling was done from the three strata or listings of households according to migration status. Separate sampling was done from each stratum using systematic sampling.  In case of a refusal or other reason for non-response, another household was selected from the same stratum to reach the desired quota.   In case the number of households listed in any of the three strata was smaller than the numbers desired (4, 3, 3), then all those listed in that stratum were automatically sampled and the short fall selected from the next stratum. 

For example, if there were, say, 150 households in an EA, with 3 with international migrants, 27 with internal migrants, and 120 with no migrants, the numbers selected would be, respectively, 3, 3 and 3.  But to make up 10, priority would be given to the migrant stratum to add one more, randomly selected, from that stratum.  As another example, suppose there were 0 international migrant households; then 7 would be selected from the internal migrant stratum and still only 3 from the list of non-migrant households.

The choice of 10 households per EA was based on experience from the various economic surveys conducted by UBOS, where 10 households provide adequate representation at EA level for most of the economic and social indicators. 

The listing operation

The survey targeted household with in-migrants or former members who have migrated away, whether to another part of the country (urban or rural) or to another country. Since the census frame does not uniquely identify who is a migrant or non migrant, and owing to the lack of an up to date list of all households in Uganda from which to draw the sample, the survey team adopted a listing exercise as stop gap measure. 

The exercise involved conducting a fresh listing of all households in each of the selected EAs. During the exercise, households with migrants were identified and the migrants clearly categorized as internal-within Uganda- or international where household members had moved to another country all together. The total number of listed household numbers was 24,618. Thereafter, a sample of 10 households was selected using systematic sampling procedure.",Face-to-face,"The questionnaire consisted of seven sections namely:
A Cover Sheet requiring  household identification particulars including district name and code, county name and code, parish name and code, EA name, stratum, household number, names of the household head and first spouse, number of household members and a description of the location of the household.

In addition, the page captured details of the interview including the interviewer name, date, duration and the outcome of the interview. It also provided for the team leaders remarks and signature.

Section 1: Household roster
This section captured the socio-demographic characteristics of all household members.

Section 2: Households housing conditions
In this section, information was sought on the type of dwelling, occupancy status, the physical characteristics of the dwelling, and access to basic utilities including water, electricity and sanitation.  

Section 3 Household Assets and Expenditure
The section collected information on the assets and expenditures of the household. This information was used to determine the welfare status of the household.

Section 4: Household Use of Financial Services:
In this section, information relating to use of financial services by household members was collected. 

Section 5: Internal and International Migration And Remittances From Former Household Members
This section captured information on migration, both internal and international as well as remittances received by the household from former household member migrants.

Section 6: Internal and International Migration and Remittances From Former Household Members
Like section 5 above, section 6 sought information on migration, both internal and international as well as remittances received by the household from non household member migrants.

Section 7: Return Migrants
Here information on Return migrants was captured. A return migrant was defined as an adult member (over 18 years old) currently living in the household, who had lived in another country or another place in Uganda for at least 3 months in the 5 years preceding the survey.  The information sought in this section related to the last migration episode for each return migrant.","The first stage comprised of total number of households in the listed EAs and the total number of households in the entire frame. The total number of households was used as the measure of size. 

At the second stage, the total number of households listed was used to select the sample of 10 as described above. This fraction constituted the second stage weights.

The product of these two weights, with the appropriate sampling fraction, yielded the final EA/household weights used. (Note that the reciprocal of the weight).","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The sampling frame was the 2006 National Population Census. For administrative purposes, Nigeria has 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. These states are grouped into six geopolitical zones - the North Central, North East, North West, South East, South South and South West. The states in turn are divided into 776 Local Governments. The demographic and political characteristics of the states vary considerably. For example, the number of component local government areas in the states ranges from 8 in Bayelsa State (in the South South) to 44 in Kano State (in the North West). Likewise state populations vary widely from 1.41 million in the Abuja Federal Capital Territory to 9.38 million in Kano State. The National Bureau of Statistics splits the country further into 23, 070 enumeration areas (EAs). While the enumeration areas are equally distributed across the local government areas, with each local government area having 30 enumeration areas, the differences in the number of local government areas across states implies that there are also huge differences in the number of enumeration areas across states. Appendix table 1 summarizes the population according to the 2006 population census (in absolute and proportionate numbers), number of local government areas, and number of enumeration areas in each state . 

Given the above, a stratified random sampling technique was thought to be needed to select areas according to population and the expected prevalence of migrants.  The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) provided a randomly selected set of enumeration areas and households spread across all states in the Federation from the 2006 sampling frame. Every state in Nigeria has three senatorial zones (often referred to as North, Central and South or East, Central and West). The NBS sample enumeration areas were distributed such that within each state, local government areas from each senatorial zones were included in the sample, with Local Governments in each state nearly evenly distributed between rural and urban areas. In all, a total of 3188 enumeration areas were selected. These enumeration areas were unevenly spread across States; some states in the North West (Kano, Katsina, and Jigawa), and a few in the South South (Akwa Ibom and Delta) had over 100 enumeration areas selected while others such as Imo and Abia in the South East, and Borno, Gombe and Taraba in the North East, had as few as 20 enumeration areas selected. This selection partially reflected the relative population distribution and number of Local Government Areas in the component states. Annex Table B shows details of the states and geopolitical regions, their shares in population of the country, the number of Local Government Areas and enumeration areas in each state and the number of enumeration areas given in the NBS list that formed the frame for the study. 

B.	The Sample for the Migration Survey

a.	Sample Selection of States, Local Governments and Enumeration Areas 
Originally, the intention was to have proportionate allocation across all states, using the population of each state in the 2006 Census to select the number of households to be included in the sample. But it was later recognized that this would not yield enough migrant households, particularly those with international migrants, especially as the total number of households that could likely be covered in the sample to was limited to 2000. Consequently, a disproportionate sampling approach was adopted, with the aim of oversampling areas of the country with more migrants. According to Bilsborrow (2006), this approach becomes necessary because migrants are rare populations for which a distinct disproportionate sampling procedure is needed to ensure they are adequately captured. Given the relative rareness of households with out-migrants to international destinations within the 10 year reference period (selected by the World Bank for all countries) prior to the planned survey, sampling methods appropriate for sampling rare elements were desirable, specifically, stratified sampling with two-phase sampling at the last stage. 

Establishing the strata would require that there be previous work, say from the most recent Census, to determine migration incidence among the states. However, the needed census data could not be obtained from either the National Bureau of Statistics or the National Population Commission. Therefore, the stratification procedure had to rely on available literature, particularly Hernandez-Coss and Bun (2007), Agu (2009) and a few other recent, smaller studies on migration and remittances in Nigeria. Information from this literature was supplemented by expert judgement about migration from team members who had worked on economic surveys in Nigeria in the past. Information from the literature and the expert assessment indicated that migration from households is considerably higher in the South than in the North. Following this understanding, the states were formed into two strata- those with high and those with low incidence of migration. In all, 18 States (16 in the South and 2 in the North) were put into the high migration incidence stratum while 19 states (18 in the North and 1 in the South) were classified l into the low migration incidence stratum (column C of Appendix Table 1).

The Aggregate population of the 18 states in the high migration incidence stratum was 67.04 million, spread across 10,850 Enumeration areas. Thus, the mean population of an EA in the high migration stratum was 6179. In turn, the aggregate population of the 19 states in the low migration incidence stratum was 72.95 million spread across 12,110 EAs yielding a mean EA population of 6024. These numbers were close enough to assume the mean population of EAs was essentially the same. To oversample states in the high stratum, it was decided to select twice as high a proportion of the states as in the low stratum. To further concentrate the sample and make field work more efficient in being oriented to EAs more likely to have international migrants, we decided to select randomly twice as many LGAs in each state in the high stratum states as in the low stratum states. 

Thus, 12 states were randomly selected with probabilities of selection proportionate to the population size of each state (so states with larger populations were accordingly more likely to fall in the sample) from the high stratum states. Then two LGAs were randomly selected from each sample state and 2 EAs per sample LGA (one urban, one rural) to yield a total of 12 x 2 x 2 or 48 EAs in the high stratum states. For the low stratum, 6 states were randomly selected. From each of these, 1 LGA was randomly picked and 2 EAs were selected per sample LGA to give a total of 6 x 1 x 2 or 12 EAs in the low stratum. This yielded a total of 60 EAs for both strata. Given the expected range of 2000 households to be sampled, approximately 67 households were to be sampled from each local government area or 34 households from each enumeration area. 

So far, the discussion has assumed two groups of households - migrant and non-migrant households. However, the study was interested in not just lumping all migrants together, but rather in classifying migrants according to whether their destination was within or outside the country. Migrant households were thus subdivided into those with former household members who were international migrants and those with former household members who were internal migrants. Three strata of households were therefore required, namely: 

1. 	Households with an international migrant: at least one person who was a member of the household since Jan. 1, 2000 left to live in an international destination and has remained abroad;
2. 	Households with an internal migrant: at least one person who was a member of the household  since Jan. 1, 2000 left to live elsewhere in Nigeria (outside the sample LGA) and has not returned to the LGA; and 
3. 	Households with no migrant: No member of the household has left to live elsewhere either within or outside the country since Jan. 1, 2000.

The selection of states to be included in the sample from both strata was based on Probabilities of Selection Proportional to (Estimated) Size or PPES. The population in each stratum was cumulated and systematic sampling was performed, with an interval of 12.16 million for the low stratum (72.95 million divided by 6 States), and 5.59 million for the high stratum (67.04 million divided by 12 States). This yields approximately double the rate of sampling in the high migration stratum, as earlier explained.  Using a random start between 0 and 12.16, the following states were sampled in the low stratum: Niger, Bauchi, Yobe, Kano, Katsina, and Zamfara.  In the high stratum, states sampled were Abia, Ebonyi, Imo, Akwa Ibom, Delta, Edo, Rivers, Lagos, Ondo, Osun and Oyo. Given its large population size, Lagos fell into the sample twice. The final sample, with LGAs and EAs moving from North to South (i.e. from the low to the high stratum states) is presented in Table 1 below.

The sample was concentrated in the South since that is where it was expected that more households have international migrants. It was expected that the survey would still also be reasonably representative of the whole country and of both internal migrant and non-migrant households through weighting the data. To this effect, field teams were asked to keep careful track at all stages of the numbers of people and households listed compared to the number in the actual sample in each stratum, at all stages of sampling; from the first stage of sampling states (the Primary Sampling Units, or PSUs), to Local Governments (LGs), and finally Enumeration Areas or EAs (see below). It is worth noting that the number of EAs to be selected from each sample LG is miniscule in every state compared to the total number of EAs in the state. Overall, the intended sample of about 2000 households would yield about 13 thousand persons, or only 0.00008 of the huge population of Nigeria. Eventually, a total of 2,251 households with 13,415 individuals were actually sampled.

The next steps, then, were to select the local government areas (LGs) and enumeration areas (the last stage or ultimate sampling units, or UAUs), and then finally select households from the sample EAs in the selected states in each stratum. To select local government areas, it was decided a priori to maintain a balance between rural and urban areas. In the Northern States where there was to be only one LG selected per sample state, this selection was made randomly. Fortunately, with the urbanization rate at approximately 50 percent, there is a near balanced distribution of rural and urban areas in the country. The distribution between urban and rural areas of the selected local government areas was therefore fairly equal, as expected. For the Southern States, initially only two Local Governments were provided for in the sample, so an attempt was made to select one rural and one urban centre in each state. In some cases though, the distinction between urban and rural areas was blurred by insufficient information. It was also considered useful to ensure that the two local government areas selected fall in at least two different senatorial zones to improve representation of cultural and other differences among peoples in each state. Where such differences were considered not too significant to warrant special attention, equal representation of rural and urban areas was prioritized. 

c.	Sample Selection of Households
The mean population size of the EAs in Nigeria in the 2006 census was around 6000 persons in both strata (and assumed to be slightly larger by 2009).  The number of households is therefore near 1000 on average, and always more than 100. Given available resources, it had been determined that it would be possible (and sufficient) to list only 100 to 150 households in each sample EA. To do this, each sample EA therefore had to be partitioned using a defined procedure into an average of 6 to 10 segments before, one of which is randomly selected. This ordinarily would require local maps or landmarks, perhaps a listing of dwellings, consultations with local government officials or police, etc. But there were no adequate maps for most areas. In fact, only major cities such as Lagos and Abuja had such maps, mainly street maps. Here, the NBS sample of 3188 enumeration areas was useful since maps were not available from previous surveys. The NBS sample contained sample listings of about 10 households in each of the 3188 enumeration areas in its national sample frame, obtained with the the intention that in a proportionate random sample across all states all ten would be interviewed. But in the present context, with the adoption of disproportionate sampling, the team found the randomly generated list of households useful only in locating a segment of each enumeration area. Thus for each sample enumeration area, about 90 adjoining households (the number depending on the team and the distribution  of settlements in each enumeration area) were added to the list of 10 NBS selected households to make a total of 100 or more households to be listed. This made it unnecessary to develop complex partitioning directions for field teams. The 10 original households in the NBS list for each enumeration area might or might not be in the final sample given that they are only 10 of 100 or so listed households, and only a maximum of 34 could ever be sampled (see below). The teams were allowed to take on the nearest adjoining 90 households to the 10 selected. The count could go in any direction for highly populated places. In some cases where the population of an EA is small, teams could take on other households that may not be exactly adjoining to make a list of 100 or so households. This way, it became irrelevant what the partitioning system could be for all households within the enumeration area and no new randomization or selection procedure for the partitioned enumeration area was needed. 

To simplify weighting, it was decided to evenly allocate the sample of 2000 or so households across local government areas in the sample. For states with 2 local government areas, that  meant having twice as much households in the sample compared to the states with only one local government area. Since most of the states with two or more local government areas are in the South with potentials for higher migration incidence, this achieves the basic purpose of oversampling households with migrants (international and internal). Dividing the total expected number of 2000 questionnaires by the 30 local government areas in the list gave an average of 68 questionnaires per local government area, i.e., 34 per EA. This was the original sampling plan, called Procedure A.

d.	Household Listing and Sampling Procedures

Actual sampling of the households in the last stage of the 4-stage sample involved 2-phase sampling that, in the first phase, lists all households in a randomly selected part of the EA with about 100 occupied households (in both urban and rural EAs). Once a 'partition' was selected, the team listed the households in the partition, to show  how many of the households were in the three strata - households with no (out-)migrant since year 2000, households with one or more internal migrants, and households with one or more international migrants. Households with no one in the eligible age group of interest, viz., thought to be involved in making their own migration decisions, taken to be persons aged 15 to 59, were excluded from the list of eligible households to be sampled.  Thus only households with someone who had actually been aged 15 to 59 at the time of migration and who had left since January 1, 2000, and were still living away at the time of interview in 2009, were classified as households with migrants for the study. Households with only children under age 15 or persons aged 60 or more were recorded in the supervisor listing sheet summary but not eligible to be sampled even as non-migrant households. The reason is that the study of the determinants and consequences of migration-part of the goal of the survey was to provide data for that-would require that non-migrant households contain some adult aged 15-59, for comparison with the households which had someone leave in that adult age group. It was thus necessary to list more than 100 households, say 105 or 110 households, to have 100 at risk of having a relevant out-migrant or non-migrant. Even though such households are rare in Nigeria, this procedure was adopted to ensure an adequate sample size. The procedure also makes sense to allow for non-response.   

Listing sheets and supervisor field control sheets were provided to team leaders.  In addition, ""supervisor sampling sheets"" were prepared and provided to team leaders and supervisors for selecting (sampling) households from the three strata of households designated above. 

Early in the fieldwork, it was determined that Procedure A based on the selection of 34 households from a listing of 100 to 150 per EA would not yield sufficient households with international migrants, and would, moreover, involve listing more households than necessary and hence involve longer and more costly fieldwork. This led to replacing Procedure A with Procedures B and ultimately C in the final stage of selecting households for interview in Enumeration Areas, the Ultimate Area Units (UAUs). Sections IVB,C describe and compare the three procedures below. 

The number of households to be interviewed in a sample EA was originally set at 34 in Procedure A, with a fixed maximum of 12 households allocated to each of the two groups of households with international or internal migrants, and 10 to the households without migrants. Where the number of international or internal migrants was up to 12 in each group, all were selected automatically for interview. If the number was more than that, then 12 of each type of households were randomly selected from whatever the aggregate number was in the listing for each group. It was ensured that this was done while the team was in the EA, usually by the team leader, using a table of random numbers or other convenient random selection process. The balance, to achieve a total of 34 in the three strata combined, would be selected from the non-migrant household stratum. It was expected that there would always be sufficient number of non-migrant households. So, in an extreme case in which the quotas of 12 households each with recent international and internal migrants (as defined) were both filled, then only 10 households having no migrants need be selected for interview, to reach the maximum of 34 per EA. In such situations, the procedure would result in oversampling households with international migrants compared to those with internal migrants and non-migrants.  But there was no a priori reason to expect that situations in which there were at least 12 households with recent international migrants would dominate.  Thus if the listing produced, say, 2 households with international migrants, 40 with internal migrants, and 108 with no migrants, Procedure A would lead to samples from the three strata, respectively, of 2, 12 and 20, and hence few international migrants despite the large listing efforts.  

With some concerns about non-response, it was allowed for teams to select up to 14 each from strata 1 and 2, and 11 from stratum 3, to ensure getting at least 12, 12, and 10 completed responses in most situations. Shortfalls in stratum 1 and 2 would be made up by increasing the number interviewed in stratum 3. This means a final range of 0 to 12 households in stratum 1, 0 to 12 households in stratum 2, and 10 to 20 households in stratum 3, in each EA (the maximum in stratum 3 being fixed at 20).  The result of this process would be to select and hopefully interview up to 34 households in each sample EA. The total number of households in the survey would then be about 2000 or more. However, a major  problem with this approach is that it guaranteed sampling and interviewing more internal migrants than international migrants, since there would be far more cases in which there would not be 12 households listed with qualified international migrants than 12 households with internal migrants.",Face-to-face,"· Questionnaire was designed by the World Bank; updated and contextualized by Zibah Consults
· Tested in a pilot survey conducted in Enugu and Kogi States of Nigeria
· Language of design was English. Enumerators however came from the local areas covered in the survey and were trained to elicit information as contained in the questionnaire in local languages","Weighting the data is critical in this project given that the sample selected is not an epsem sample, in which all elements (households) in the sample had an equal probability of being selected. Rather, the sample was explicitly designed to oversample areas and households with international migrants. Therefore, it is not a self-weighting sample in which the (unweighted) sample mean of the values for sample households is a reliable estimate of the population mean. Instead, the sampling procedures used aimed at selecting a sample that would have sufficient numbers of households with recent migrants to international destinations, which are relatively rare elements in the large population of Nigeria (or most any national population). This required the use of special sampling procedures (see Bilsborrow et al., 1997; Groenewold and Bilsborrow, 2008) to ensure that the actual sample of households interviewed included sufficient households with migrants, i.e., much larger than their share in the national population.

Overall, the sample selection involved four-stages, the selection of states, the selection of Local Government Areas, the selection of Enumeration Areas, and the Selection of Households. Though they have been severally referred to and described above, we briefly review each selection stage as follows. The Selection of States was the first stage, which required stratifying all states in the country according to the expected proportion of households in each state with international migrants. Due to the lack of access to data on migration from the 2006 census (the most recent), expert opinion and available literature were relied upon to classify the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory into high and low migration strata. Eighteen states were classified in the high migration stratum (16 in the South, 2 in the North), and 19 states were classified in the low migration stratum (18 in the North, 1 in the South).  The proportion of the population in the high migration stratum to be sampled was then taken to be double that of the low stratum.  This yielded a sample of 12 states out of the 18 in the high stratum and 6 states out of the 19 in the low stratum, with an approximate relative weight of 3/1 for all households in the low stratum compared to 3/2 for households in the high stratum, or double the weight for households in the low compared to the high stratum. To be more precise, the total population of the high stratum states in the 2006 census was 67.04 million, compared to 72.95 million in the 19 states in the low stratum.  Therefore, stage I weights for households in the two strata are 67.04/12 = 5.5867 in the high stratum compared to 72.95/6 = 15.4917 in the low stratum. This approach achieves an additional benefit in that it stratifies the entire country by population so that the population of the sample can represent the population of the entire country 

The second stage of the sample was the selection of Local Government Areas (LGAs), which constitute the next lower administrative units in states. To further concentrate the sample of areas among those expected to have a higher proportion of international migrants; it was decided to select two LGAs from each sample state in the high stratum and one LGA from each in the low stratum. As explained in Section IVB, it was realized that the initial number of LGAs was insufficient to produce the total sample size desired, which  was corrected for by (1) increasing the number of LGAs in all sample areas by 50 percent, and (2) increasing the number of households to be selected at the last stage from 20 to 25 (moving from Procedure B to Procedure C, explained earlier). This translated to selecting 3 LGAs instead of 2 in each high stratum state sampled and 1.5 instead of 1 in each low stratum state. The final result was that All states in the South had three LGAs in the sample (Lagos had six as it was sampled twice). Kano, Niger and Yobe were selected from the low stratum states to have 2 Local Governments each instead of 1. 

At the Local Government sampling stage, it was considered important to explicitly incorporate the rural/urban divide of the sample in order to better represent these two groups of the population. This was particularly important given that it was not incorporated into the selection of states and in any case, there is no exclusively rural or exclusively urban state in the country; each state has a share of both. Ordinarily, it could make sense to divide the LGAs into rural and urban, and then purposively sample one of each from each sample state. But according to Oluwasola (2007) and the United Nations (2008), Nigeria is one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in the world. In 2006, the urban population was estimated to be 46 percent of the total, up from 11 percent in 1952. This implies that about 65 million of the country's 140 million lived in urban centres in 2006; so the urban population was estimated to be about half by the time of the survey in late 2009. Given the above, a random sample of Local Governments Areas would produce approximately the same statistical result as a purposive sampling if the target was to have equal numbers of urban and rural LGAs (discussed also above). 

To weight the LGAs, the number selected in each sample state as a proportion of the total number in the state indicates the probability of selection, so the inverse is the LGA weight for the state. Thus every selected household in the sample LGA will have the weight indicated attached to it, in the final computation of household weights. 

The third stage was the selection of Enumeration Areas from LGAs. The total number of EAs in Nigeria in the 2006 census is about 23,000, with the number per state varying from 180 to 1350 and the number in sample states from 360 to 1350. The reason for this variation is that the number of LGAs per state varies so much though the number of EAs per LGA remains 30. So it should have been desirable to obtain the census population of each sample LGA and of each EA in each sample LGA to know what the population in the sample EA represents. These data were also not available from the National Bureau of Statistics; only information on the population of each LGA was available. We thus assumed that the population of each EA in the sample LGA was approximately the same. Thus Given that 2 EAs were selected out of 30 EAs in every sample LGA, the probability of the selection of an EA was 2/30, and the weight for all sample EAs in the survey is straightforward, i.e., the inverse of 30/2 or 0.06666.   

The last stage was the selection of households within each sample EA. As has severally been referred to in this report, the survey involved three distinct phases of selection of households from EAs, referred to as Procedures A, B and C. Procedure A involved listing about 150 households in an EA, identifying their migration status, and selecting randomly a total of 34. The instruction given at that time was that any sample household which refused the interview or for any other reason did not provide the data requested should be replaced by another household selected randomly from the list guaranteeing 34 completed households per EA.  However, there was no actual replacement during the fieldwork using procedure A. Since quotas of a maximum of 12 households with international migrants, 12 with internal migrants, and 10 non-migrants were to be selected, with the sum being 34, the weights were to be computed as follows for those EAs in which Procedure A was used (mainly in the North). So if X1, X2 and X3 are the actual numbers of households listed in the three strata, and n1, n2 and n3 are the numbers actually sampled (following the procedures described in III B above), then the weight for each international migrant household selected in the EA is X1/n1, while the weights for each internal migrant and non-migrant household are respectively X2/n2 and X3/n3.

Procedure B involved listing 50 to 100 households in the sample EA, and recording the numbers in each stratum. In the first step, up to 10 households with one or more (recent) international migrants were selected. Where the total number of households with international migrants in the list was less than or equal to 10, all were selected, meaning each of those households had the same 100 percent chance of being selected. Where the number selected was less than the total number of households with international migrants listed in the EA, then the probability of selection was 10/X1, where X1 is the total number listed, and the weight for each household in stratum 1 is X1/10. In the second step in Procedure B, households with internal migrants were selected with the probability calculated as the ratio of the number selected to the total number in the stratum, allowing a maximum of 7. Again, if there were more households listed than 7, say Z, the probability of selection of each is 7 divided by that number, and the weight is the inverse, or Z/7 or Z/n2. The last step was to sample non-migrant households in the third stratum. For any numbers fewer than 10 in stratum 1 or fewer than 7 in stratum 2, there would be a corresponding increase in the sample size selected from stratum 3. This number was determined before drawing the sample, but would always be at least 3 since a maximum total sample size from each EA was set at 20, meaning that even with a maximum selected in strata 1 and 2 (17), three non-migrant households would be selected. Again, the weight is X3/n3, as before, but following the supervisor sampling sheet for Procedure B. Finally, Procedure C is similar in methodology to Procedure B except that the total number or “sample take” per EA was increased from 20 to 25 - with the numbers in the sample in strata 1 and 2 (international and internal migrant households) allowed to increase from 10 to 12 and 7 to 10, respectively. This left the residual for non-migrant households at the same minimum of 3 for stratum 3, but a maximum of 20. Note that in Procedures B and C, there was no replacement of non-responding sample households, so the weights in all cases in both procedures B and C (and as is normal in surveys where there is no replacement of non-responding sample households) can appropriately take into account that some households selected in the sample from the list may refuse, not be at home, etc. 

To bring all the weights together from the four-stage sampling procedure, we multiplied the four weights for sample state, sample LGAs within the state, sample EAs within the LGA, and the appropriate stratum weight of the household in its sample EA. So for a particular household H in a state j denoted by Hj, the probability of selection would be the consolidated probability of the migration stratum in which the state it falls into multiplied by the weight of the LGA within the State multiplied by the weight of the Enumeration area within the LGA multiplied by the household weight based on its selection within the stratum of households that it falls into in its EA. So if weights for selecting states in stage 1 in the high and low strata are indicated by W1m where the subscript m=1,2 stands for either high or low strata; weights for LGAs in each sample state in stage 2 are given by W2L with subscript L indicating the sample LGA in the state; and weights for selecting EAs from sample LGAs in stage 3 are designated by W3e with subscript e representing 30/2. Finally, weights for households in the last stage are given by W4S, with the subscript S representing any one of the three household strata (international, internal and non-migrant households).

The total weight W applied to a household (or individual migrant in a household) in Stratum S and EA designated by e, within Local Government L in State m, is given by:

Each region hosts predominantly one refugee nationality leading to an implicit stratification based on nationality. In each stratum, camps were divided into Enumeration Areas (EAs) of equal size using GIS technology, and 82 EAs were selected per stratum. Within the stratum, the number of EAs per camp was selected proportional to the size of the camp. Within camps, EAs were selected with equal probability. Within each selected EA, all households were listed and then 12 were randomly selected for interview. 

The host community sample consisted of the same four regional strata. Within each stratum, areas within a 5km radius of a camp, were divided into EAs of equal size.

The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. For refugees, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum, multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households, and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA (usually 12) divided by the total number of households listed in the EA. Sampling weights for refugees were scaled to equal the number of households per strata as per the sampling frame provided by UNHCR. Due to changes in the sample during fieldwork, the number of EAs surveyed in each stratum differed from the original sample.

However, the recent refugee influx that doubled the number of refugees in the country in less than three years represents a challenge for the institutions, programs and mechanisms in place. The recent arrivals have put additional pressure on the public services delivery system, and to some central elements of the response approach, such as land availability for refugee use. The influx is also aggravated by the fact that refugee hosting areas were already vulnerable due to underlying poverty, limited resilience to shocks, limited capacity of local institutions, and low levels of human capital. Without the adequate response, the prolonged and steady refugee influx represents a challenge for the sustainability of Uganda’s approach.

Moreover, it is representative of the refugee and host population in the regions of West Nile and South West, and the city of Kampala. The host population is defined as the native population in districts where refugee settlements are situated. The survey used two different sampling frames. The first one, based on the list of Enumeration Areas (EAs) and the information of the 2014 Uganda Population and Housing Census, was used to determine the samples for the host and refugee populations of Kampala, and the host populations in West Nile and Southwest. The second one is a newly developed sampling frame for the refugee population in the West Nile and Southwest regions.

Given the nature of the survey, the sample is stratified by three separate domains. The first domain is the host population in the regions of West Nile and South West. The second is the refugee population in the regions of West Nile and Southwest, and the third, the refugee and host population in Kampala. A total of 221 primary sample units were allocated to the three different domains. For each domain, the sample was obtained based on a two-stage stratified sample of households. In the first stage, PSUs were selected using a Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling method. For the host communities and Kampala, before the selection of the PSUs, district EAs were sorted by residence type (urban/rural), district sub-county, parish, village and EAs. For Kampala, only EAs that contained more than ten refugee households according to the 2014 Census were considered. With this sorting and PPS for the selection of PSUs, implicit stratification by residence type was achieved. For the refugee settlements, EAs were sorted based on the Settlement, Zone, Block, Cluster, Village, EA and by dominant country of origin. The latter was intended to ensure that PSUs with refugees coming from different countries of origin were selected.

Between the first and second stages, a household listing operation was carried out in all selected PSUs outside Kampala. For the listing operation, all selected PSUs were visited and the residential households were located with their address and the name of the household head was recorded. In the second stage, for each selected PSU, ten households were selected from the newly established list using a systematic sampling approach. Household selection was performed in the field prior to the main survey and interviewers only interviewed selected households. This means that no replacements or changes to selected households was allowed in the implementation stage in order to prevent bias. With this design, the survey selected 2,209 residential households, distributed geographically across 13 districts of Uganda

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites, and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey was designed to address these shortcomings and support the settlement's development framework, as well as the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals. Data were collected in November 2018 to January 2019, covering about 6004 households.",2018-11-22-2019-01-1,Household and individual,"Kalobeyei Settlement, Kenya",Sample survey data [ssd],"The survey included a range of socio-economic indicators, both at the household and individual household member levels, aligned with the national 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) and forthcoming Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS). 

Two socio-economic questionnaires were administered - the Basic and the Extended Questionnaires. While all households received the Basic questionnaire, 18.5 percent among them were randomly sampled for the extended questionnaire. 

The scope of the questionnaire includes:
- Education (Basic and Extended)
- Employment (Basic and Extended)
- Household Characteristics (Basic and Extended)

Data collection occurred concurrently with a UNHCR registration verification exercise. Registration records were updated for all households in the settlement. A systematic random sample was then selected for an extended SEP interview. Those who were not selected for the extended interview were administered a shorter, basic version of the questionnaire. For this survey, a stratified single-stage sample design was applied. The sample was implicitly stratified for the three villages in the settlement. For the Basic SEP, all households in the settlement are selected and the selection probability is 1. For the Extended SEP, a targeted sample size of 1500 households was required to obtain a 15 percent difference in the poverty rates of 2 groups in the sample at a confidence level of 95 percent and a power of 80 percent. To randomly select these households, a straight forward approach was used to select these households from registered proGres families before the exercise. Thus, households that received the extended SEP were randomly determined before the start of the survey using the tablet. The sample of the extended survey alone is representative and therefore sufficient for generating poverty estimates headline indicators for the population as a whole.

It is a representative survey of the post-2017 population of displaced Rohingya and households in host communities in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh.

The high-frequency phone tracking (HFT) surveys were built to maintain communication with baseline respondents while collecting rapid data on key welfare indicators on labor, basic needs and education. Three rounds of the HFT have been completed between 2020-2021, which have been used to produce welfare updates on the host and Rohingya population residing in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, particularly amidst the COVID-19 crisis.

The surveys collect standard indicators across both Rohingya and host populations. However, it should be noted that camps operate under different policy regulations compared to hosts, and as such, indicators and findings, for all three dimensions, are not directly comparable. 

Labor: The baseline survey administered the labor module on 2-3 randomly selected adults in the household. For the tracking survey, any one of the 2-3 adults who had completed the baseline survey were interviewed in a given tracking round. Weights were re-adjusted in each of the tracking rounds to ensure comparability with baseline population characteristics.

Access to basic needs: The basic needs modules across the rounds have collected information on a variety of topics ranging from a household's ability to have purchased basic food items, difficulties faced in obtaining said items, access to health services, consumption patterns and credit seeking behavior. All data collected is at household level.

Education: The education module was introduced in R2 and has collected information on educational engagement of school-aged children (all 3-18 years old at baseline 2019) amidst COVID-19. Note that the modules ask about any engagement in educational activities and not about school enrolment in context of COVID-19 school closures, thus comparisons with baseline figures should be approached carefully.

Note that Round 1 collected information on labor and access to basic needs only; the module on education was added Round 2 onwards. 

Please refer to the published briefs for details on how the indicators and findings should be inferred. Briefs are available here: https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bangladesh/brief/cox-s-bazar-panel-survey-briefs",NA,"The CBPS study has a total sample size of 5,020 households (HHs), divided among three strata covering Rohingya refugees in camps and host communities in Cox’s Bazar district and some adjacent regions of Bandarban district. The CBPS HFT attempted to follow the full baseline sample of 5,020 household in each round, with no alterations or additions made to the sampling design. The baseline sampling strategy is detailed below. 
The three strata are defined as:  
i. Rohingya refugees in camps 
ii. High exposure hosts: hosts within 15 km (3-hour walking distance) of camps
iii. Low exposure hosts: hosts at more than 15 km (3-hour walking distance) from camps
(In the datasets, the 'settlement_type' and 'stratum' variables identify the different levels at which the sample is representative)

Defining the camp strata: A two-step data collection on Rohingya refugee prevalence within host communities (i.e., outside of camps) confirmed that prevalence in host communities was low, and that this was the case not only for newer Rohingya displaced, but for the older cohort of displaced, as well. This pattern of refugee prevalence supported having one stratum for the Rohingya displaced living in camps. The sampling strategy for the CBPS therefore focused on generating representative estimates for the camp based Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar district.

Defining the host strata: For hosts, the sampling strategy was designed to account for the differential implications of a camp-based concentration of close to a million Rohingya displaced for different areas of Cox’s Bazar. To distinguish between host communities that are differentially affected by the arrival of the Rohingya, the CBPS sampling strategy used a threshold of three hours’ walking time from a campsite to define two survey strata: (i) host communities with potentially high exposure (HE) to the displaced Rohingya, and (ii) host communities with potentially low exposure (LE).

Sampling frame: The camp sample uses the Needs and Population Monitoring Round 12 (NPM12) data from the International Organization for Migration as the sampling frame. For the host sample, a combination of the 2011 population census, Admin 4 shapefiles from the Bureau of Statistics and publicly available Google Earth imagery and OpenStreetMaps were used to develop a sampling frame.

Stages of sample selection: For camps, NPM12 divided all camps into 1,954 majhee blocks.1 200 blocks were randomly selected using a probability proportional to the size of the camp. A full listing was carried out in each selected camp block.

For hosts, a two-stage sampling strategy was followed. The first stage of selection was done at the mauza level by strata. A random sample of 66 mauzas was drawn from a frame of 286 mauzas using probability proportional to size. Based on census population size, each mauza was divided into segments of roughly 100-150 households. The second stage selected three segments from each selected mauza with equal probability of selection.

Listing and replacements: Within each selected PSU in camps (blocks) and hosts (mauza-segments), all households (100-150 on average) were listed. Of listed households, 13 households were selected at random for interview, with an additional replacement list of 5 households. 
More information on the sampling strategy and process can be found on the published working paper titled “Data Triangulation Strategies to Design a Representative Household Survey of Hosts and Rohingya Displaced in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh”.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The R1 tracking questionnaire was developed as a lean version of the questionnaire implemented during the CBPS baseline. The R2 and R3 questionnaires retained certain aspects of the R1 questionnaire, but also added more detailed questions on aspects such as food security (in consultation with UN-WFP) and credit-seeking and coping behavior based on findings observed in previous rounds and dynamic research needs within the COVID-19 crisis.

One questionnaire was developed per round of data collection with modules containing household level questions on access to basic needs, credit-seeking behavior, access to health services, vaccinations and individual level questions on labor market status. Any adult, knowledgeable member of the confirmed sample household were eligible to answer the household modules. The labor module was only permitted if the respondent reached was any one of the 2-3 selected adults within the household who had completed the baseline adult questionnaires.

Questionnaires were developed in English and translated into Bengali. The translations to Bengali were thoroughly reviewed by the World Bank team’s local consultants to ensure quality. Pretesting and piloting were done using the Bengali questionnaires.

All questionnaires and modules in English are provided as external resources.","There are three types of weights in the CBPS baseline datasets. In what follows, the “level” of a dataset refers to what each observation in the data set represents i.e. a household, an individual, an occupation of an individual, etc. In general, the appropriate weight to be used is based on the unit of sampling: i.e. HH weights should be used for data collected at the level of the household (i.e. the household survey); and AA weights should be used for data collected at the level of individual adults i.e. the adult survey).

The two types of baseline weights – household weight and adult weight – have been readjusted for each tracking round based on the response rate. The respective tracking round weights are available on each dataset. Labor datasets contain aa_weight_r# and the basic needs datasets contain hh_weight_r#. The education datasets do not contain weights variable as individual roster member weights were not created during the baseline.

The sample size was calculated based on the total number of refugee groups (as the proxy to the total number of households) registered in UNHCR ProGres database as of November 2020.

Systematic random sampling with a fixed periodic interval was conducted in each camps to select the households. An alternative list of households was prepared before going to the field. The enumerators visited the households on this list if the interview with the originally sampled households could not be undertaken with justified reasons.

At the household level, in principle, either the household head or spouse (in the absence of the head) or any adult member of the household (in the absence of both the household head and the spouse) were interviewed. Enumerator did not exclude the child-headed households if sampled.

There are over 2.2 million refugees spread across Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the Central African Republic (CAR) a further 1.8 million people are displaced internally in South Sudan. An estimated 140,000 South Sudanese spontaneously returnees are reported to have returned to South Sudan from November 2018 to date.

The South Sudan situation continues to be characterized as a children's tragedy with children constituting over 65 percent of the refugee population. The Revitalised Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) foresees the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU) with all the parties in agreement including the leader of the SPLA IO and first vice president by May 2019.

In November 2018, it was agreed during the Kampala Representatives meeting that intention surveys should be conducted for South Sudanese refugees in all countries of asylum. This was further concretized in March 2019, during the EHA/GLR planning meeting; here it was decided that UNHCR country representations of CAR, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Sudan, Ethiopia would ensure that a rapid intention survey of South Sudanese refugees in their respective asylum countries is carried out before May 2019, in line with the agreed calendar of the R-ARCSS

The Intention Survey was a cross-sectional survey conducted among the over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees living in six countries of asylum using a stratified random sampling approach to survey 6,964 refugees (heads of households) in 15 camps selected across the region. In each location, sample size estimation assumed a 95 per cent confidence level, and a margin of error of 7 per cent; sample was drawn taking into account the location, place of origin, ethnicity, year of arrival to the country of asylum and gender of the head of household.

The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration.

Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.

Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).

Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.

Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. 

Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin. Similarly, internal movement within Uganda and opportunities to migrate to a new country are areas in which refugees say they lack guidance from humanitarian agencies or other actors.",2019-10-08-2019-10-3,Individuals and households,"Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja",Sample survey data [ssd],"The scope of the survey includes:
Admission and rights; emergency response and ongoing needs; resilience and self-reliance; expanded solutions; voluntary repatriation; demographics.",Ground Truth Solutions,"This survey is the third round of questions Ground Truth Solutions has asked in Uganda; the first round took place in 2017 and the second in 2018. As in previous rounds, respondents to the current round of questions have been selected randomly, but the respondents themselves are different from those in previous rounds. When designing the sampling strategy for this survey, we used the most recent figures for populations of refugees from the UNHCR refugee portal. Based on this data, we decided to focus on South Sudanese and Congolese refugees, as they made up 92% of all the refugees in Uganda at the time. Refugees from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia each made up 0-3% of the overall refugee population and were excluded from this study. This is not to say that the perspectives of more marginal groups are not important, but rather that gathering these perspectives was simply beyond the scope of our research in view of the geographical and time constraints involved. In terms of the locations selected, we decided to include Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja (and to exclude Kampala, Lobule, Oruchinga, and Palabek), as over 90% of South Sudanese and Congolese refugees reside in these refugee settlements, according to UNHCR's most recent figures. 

The actual sample size achieved was 1,511 participants from 10 refugee settlements across Uganda, and the sample size in each settlement was proportional to the population size of the targeted communities within any given settlement. Using a confidence level of 95%, this sample size affords an expected margin of error of 3%. 

Ground Truth Solutions co-led enumerator training and supervised data collection on the ground. Within each of the 10 selected settlements, we chose particular zones from which to collect data, and within these zones, we selected smaller village/cluster units. In selecting the zones, we grouped them into two or three tiers, depending on the population size within the given zones of the camp, and asked the data collection partner to select one zone from each tier in order to capture responses from differently sized areas. Within the zones, a GTS supervisor, in consultation with local leaders and actors on the ground, selected the villages/clusters based on several factors, such as when they were established, their distance from central points, and their population size.",Face-to-face,"Survey questions were developed to help understand refugees’ perceptions of the aid they receive, their relationship with humanitarian workers and the host community, and their future prospects. For the purpose of comparing this data with previous rounds, the questions in this round are phrased similarly to those in rounds one and two wherever possible. We consulted local actors and organisations in Uganda for feedback and input during the survey question design phase. Draft questions were also presented to UNHCR, the Assessment Technical Working Group (ATWG), the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), and the Office of the Prime Minister. Additional questions around voluntary repatriation, migration to a different country, and moving within Uganda were introduced this year in order to cover voluntary repatriation as the fifth pillar of the Office of the Prime Minister’s Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework.
