To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), though we do not have information for all of the steps:

Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on characteristics of the household head (i.e. education, labor force status, demographic characteristics), characteristics of the household (consumption, assets, financial characteristics), and characteristics of the dwelling (house ownership, overcrowding). While the proGRES database is limited in the number of socio-economic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the proGRES database.
Additional technical details and explanations on each of the steps briefly outlined above can be found in Himelein, K.

Weighting: Cross-Sectional weights

For the KNBS and RDD samples, to make the sample nationally representative of the current population of households with mobile phone access, we create weights in two steps.

Step 1: Construct raw weights combining the two national samples: The current population consists of
(I) households that existed in 2015/16, and did not change phone numbers,
(II) households that existed in 2015/16, but changed phone number,
(III) households that did not exist in 2015/16.

Abstracting from differential attrition, the weights from the 2015/16 KIHBS CAPI pilot make the KIHBS sample representative of type (I) households. For RDD households, we ask whether they existed in 2015/16, when they had acquired their phone number, and where they lived in 2015/16, allowing us to classify them into type (I), (II) and (III) households and assign them to KIHBS strata. We adjust weights of each RDD household to be inversely proportional to the number of mobile phone numbers used by the household, and scale them relative to the average number of mobile phone numbers used in the KIHBS within each stratum. RDD therefore gives us a representative sample of type (II) and (III) households. We then combine RDD and KIHBS type (I) households by ex-post adding RDD households into the 2015/16 sampling frame and adjusting weights accordingly. Last, we combine our representative samples of type (I), type (II) and type (III), using the share of each type within each stratum from RDD (inversely weighted by number of mobile phone numbers). Variable: weight_raw

Step 2: Scale the weights to population proportions in each county and urban/rural stratum: We use post stratification to adjust for differential attrition and response rates across counties and rural/urban strata. We scale the raw weights from step 1 to reflect the population size in each county and rural/urban stratum as recorded in the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census conducted by the KNBS (2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census, Volume II: Distribution of Population by Administrative Units, December 2019, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, https://www.knbs.or.ke/?wpdmpro=2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census-volume-ii-distribution-of-population-by-administrative-units).

Panel Weights
To construct panel weights, we follow the approach outlined in Himelein (2014): “Weight Calculations for Panel Surveys with Subsampling and Split-off Tracking”. In each household we follow one target respondent. Wherever households split, only the current household of the target respondent was interviewed. The weights for the wave 1 and 2 balanced panel are constructed by applying the following steps to the full sample of Kenyan nationals:
0. Wave 1 cross-sectional weights after post-stratification adjustment are used as a base. W_1 = W_wave1
1. Attrition adjustment through propensity score-based method: The predicted probability that a sample household was successfully re-interviewed in the second survey wave is estimated through a propensity score estimation. The propensity score (PS) is modeled with a linear logistic model at the level of the household. The dependent variable is a dummy indicating whether a household that has completed the survey in wave 1 has also done so in wave. The following covariates were used in the linear logistic model: Urban/rural dummy, County dummies, Household head gender, Household head age, Household size, Dependency ratio, Dummy: Is anyone in the household working, Asset ownership: Radio, Asset ownership: Mattress, Asset ownership: Charcoal Jiko, Asset ownership: Fridge, Wall material: 3 dummies, Floor materials: 3 dummies, Connection to electricity grid, Number of mobile phones numbers household uses, Number of phone numbers recorded for follow-up, Sample dummy for estimation with national samples
2. Rank households by PS and split into 10 equal groups
3. Calculate attrition adjustment factor: ac (attrition correction) = the reciprocal of the mean empirical response rate for the propensity score decile
4. Adjust base weights for attrition: W_2 = W_1 * ac
5. Trim top 1 percent of the weights distribution (), by replacing the weights among the top 1 percent of the distribution with the highest value of a weight below the cutoff. W_3 = trim(W_2)

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

This dataset contains information from eight waves of the COVID-19 RRPS, which is part of a panel survey that targets refugee household and started in May 2020. The same households were interviewed every two months for five survey rounds, in the first year of data collection, and every four months thereafter, with interviews conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) techniques. The sample aims to be representative of the refugee and stateless population in Kenya. It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless. Waves 1-7 of this survey include information on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, transfers, health, and COVID-19 knowledge. Wave 8 focused on how households were exposed to shocks, in particular adverse weather shocks and the increase in the price of food and fuel, but also included parts of the previous modules on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, and subjective wellbeing.
The data is uploaded in three files. The first is the hh file, which contains household level information. The 'hhid', uniquely identifies all household.  The second is the adult level file, which contains data at the level of adult household members. Each adult in a household is uniquely identified by the 'adult_id'. The third file is the child level file, available only for waves 3-7, which contains information for every child in the household. Each child in a household is uniquely identified by the 'child_id'.
The duration of data collection and sample size for each completed wave was:

It comprises five strata: Kakuma refugee camp, Kalobeyei settlement, Dadaab refugee camp, urban refugees, and Shona stateless, where sampling approaches differ across strata. For refugees in Kakuma and Kalobeyei, as well as for stateless people, recently conducted Socioeconomic Surveys (SES), were used as sampling frames. For the refugee population living in urban areas and the Dadaab camp, no such household survey data existed, and sampling frames were based on UNHCR's registration records (proGres), which include phone numbers. For Kakuma, Kalobeyei, Dadaab and urban refugees, a two-step sampling process was used. First, 1,000 individuals from each stratum were selected from the corresponding sampling frames. Each of these individuals received a text message to confirm that the registered phone was still active. In the second stage, implicitly stratifying by sex and age, the verified phone number lists were used to select the sample. Until wave 7 sampled households that were not reached in earlier waves were also contacted along with households that were interviewed before.  In wave 8 only households that had previously participated in the survey were contacted for interview. The “wave” variable represents in which wave the households were interviewed in.  For the stateless population, all the participants of the Shona socioeconomic survey (n=400) were included in the RRPS, because of limited sample size.

Section 12: Conclusion","Sampling weights for the refugee and stateless samples were tailored to the respective sampling strategies. Kakuma and Kalobeyei sub-samples have used the baseline weights from the respective SES underlying the sampling frame to adjust for any differences in the sampling probabilities. Then, propensity score weighting based on the full population covered in the SES household survey, have been used to account for differences in the probability of owning a phone number. The estimated propensity score reflects the household probability to have a phone number registered by UNHCR. To mitigate the effect of outlier estimates, the mean propensity score is computed for each decile. The baseline weights are then multiplied with the inverse of the propensity score deciles. For the refugees living in Dadaab camp and urban areas, a cell weighting approach has been used. Thereby, the sample is split into sub-groups (cells) based on the gender and age group of household head. The weights were then scaled such that they reflect the proportion of each cell in the UNHCR registration data of all refugees living in the respective location. In the group of stateless people registered with UNHCR, each household has the same weight assigned, as their full population is called in this survey. Lastly, to ensure sampling weights have the correct proportions across strata, they have been scaled to match population totals as provided by the up to date UNHCR registration data. Variable: weight
The data is also weekly representative for all waves except for wave 8. The variable weight_weekly should be used for weekly representative estimates.

Most refugees in Kenya live in camps located in the impoverished counties of Turkana (40 percent) and Garissa (44 percent), while 16 percent inhabit urban areas—mainly in Nairobi but also in Mombasa and Nakuru.
Refugees in Kenya are not systematically included in national surveys, creating a lack of comparable socioeconomic data on camp-based and urban refugees, and their hosts. As the third of a series of surveys focusing on closing this gap, this Socioeconomic Survey of Urban Refugees's aim is to understand the socioeconomic needs of urban refugees in Kenya, especially in the face of ongoing conflicts, environmental
hazards, and others shocks, as well as the recent government announcement to close Kenya’s refugee camps, which highlights the potential move of refugees from camps into urban settings
The SESs are representative of urban refugees and camp-based refugees in Turkana County. For the Kalobeyei 2018 and Urban 2020–21 SESs, households were randomly selected from the UNHCR registration database (proGres), while a complete list of dwellings,
obtained from UNHCR’s dwelling mapping exercise, was used to draw the sample for the Kakuma 2019 SES. The Kalobeyei SES and Kakuma SES were done via Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). Due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, the Urban SES
was collected via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). The Kalobeyei SES covers 6,004 households; the Kakuma SES covers 2,127 households; and the Urban SES covers 2,438 households in Nairobi, Nakuru, and Mombasa. 
Questionnaires are aligned with national household survey instruments, while additional modules are added to explore refugee-specific dynamics. The SES includes modules on demographics, household characteristics, assets, employment, education, consumption, and expenditure, which are aligned with the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) 2015–16 and the recent Kenya Continuous Household Survey (KCHS) 2019.

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the survey data was collected via telephone. Hence, the survey is representative of households with active phone numbers registered by UNHCR in urban Kenya – Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru.  A sample size of 2,500 was needed to ensure a margin of error of less than 5 percent at a confidence level of 95 percent for groups represented by at least 50 percent of the population. 
  The sample for the urban SES is designed to estimate socioeconomic indicators, such as food insecurity, for groups whose share represents at least 50 percent of the population. Considering the total urban refugee population as of August 2020 and the proportions of main countries of origin, as well as a 10 percent nonresponse rate, the target sample size is 2,500 households in total, with 1,250 in Nairobi, 700 in Nakuru, and 550 in Mombasa. A total of 2,438 households were reached: 1,300 in Nairobi, 409 in Nakuru, and 729 in Mombasa. 
  The units in ProGres list are UNHCR proGres families, which are different from households as defined in standard household surveys. Upon registration, UNHCR groups individuals into ‘proGres’ families which do not necessarily meet the criteria to be considered a household. A proGres family is usually comprised by no more than one household. In turn, a household can be integrated by one or more proGres families.
Households were selected as the unit of observation to ensure comparability with national household surveys. Households are a set of related or unrelated people (either sharing the same dwelling or not) who pool ration cards and regularly cook and eat together. As proGres families were sampled, the identification of households was done by an introductory section that confirms that each member of the selected proGres family is a member of the household and whether there are other members in the households that belong to other ProGres families. Thus, the introductory section documents the number of proGres families present in the household under observation.
Before selecting the survey strata, the team attempted to better understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phones. From the proGres data, phone penetration in urban areas is high (Nairobi and Mombasa: 93 percent, Nakuru: 95 percent). To understand the type of bias observed by focusing on refugees with access to phone, we looked at socio-economic outcomes for proGres family refugees with access to a phone number and those without",Computer Assisted Telephone Interview [cati],NA,"The sampling weights were constructed using the outline in Himelein (2014): i) as the first step, the base weight was computed, equal to 1 for all households.

Two principle methods were used to collect primary data: household questionnaire and documents review in a summative evaluation approach. 

The survey adopted a summative evaluation approach and a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods were used to obtain answers to the survey questions. The mixed approach was adopted for purposes of complementary, triangulation, and validation of responses. Primary data was collected with the use of household questionnaires, Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and review of existing literatures and reports. The inclusive criteria of the survey allowed the enumerators to collect data from household heads or any household member of age 18 years and above who consented to participate in the survey. Qualitative methods mainly KIIs were also adopted in order to gather an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of the various primary targets of the programme. These included households, members of WASH Committees, NRC staff and staff from the implementing partner agencies. Observation method was also used during the survey to assess WASH infrastructure and human habits. The infrastructure included; water points, sanitation and hygiene facilities. 

The stratified random sampling survey was carried out in in the 4 camps of Kakuma and the 3 villages of Kalobeyei. In Kakuma, all the 13 zones were included in the study for significant representation.

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites (about 40% of the total refugees in Kenya), and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey replicates the preceding Kalobeyei SES (2018), designed to address these shortcomings and support the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Most of them were Shona, descendants of missionaries who arrived from Zimbabwe and Zambia in the 1960s and remained in Kenya. The total number of Shona living in Kenya is estimated to be between 3,000 and 3,500 people. 
On their first arrival, the Shona were issued certificates of registration, but a change in the Registration of Persons Act of 1978 did not make provision for people of non-Kenyan descent, consequently denying the Shona citizenship. Zimbabwe and Zambia did not consider them nationals either, rendering them stateless. Besides the Shona, there are other groups of stateless persons of different origins and ethnicities, with the total number of stateless persons in Kenya estimated at 18,500.
UNHCR and the Government of Kenya are taking steps to address statelessness in the country, among them is the registration of selected groups for nationalization. In April 2019, the Government of Kenya pledged to recognize qualifying members of the Shona community as Kenyan citizens. However, the lack of detailed information on the stateless population in Kenya hinders advocacy for the regularization of their nationality status. Together with the Kenyan Government through the Department of Immigration Services (DIS) and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), UNHCR Kenya conducted registration and socioeconomic survey for the Shona community from May to July 2019.

The Kakuma Refugee Camps have long been among the largest hosting sites, and have become even larger in recent years, with an estimated 67 percent of the current refugee population arriving in the past five years. In 2015, UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, and partners established Kalobeyei Settlement, located 40 kilometers north of Kakuma, to reduce the population burden on the other camps and facilitate a shift towards an area-based development model that addresses the longer term prospects of both refugees and the host community. The refugee population makes up a significant share of the local population (an estimated 40 percent at the district level) and economy, engendering both positive and negative impacts on local Kenyans. While Kenya has emerged as a leader in measuring the impacts of forced displacement, refugees are not systematically included in the national household surveys that serve as the primary tools for measuring and monitoring poverty, labor markets and other welfare indicators at a country-wide level.  As a result, comparison of poverty and vulnerability between refugees, host communities and nationals remains difficult. Initiated jointly by UNHCR and the World Bank, this survey was designed to address these shortcomings and support the settlement's development framework, as well as the wider global vision laid out by the Global Refugee Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Two socio-economic questionnaires were administered - the Basic and the Extended Questionnaires. While all households received the Basic questionnaire, 18.5 percent among them were randomly sampled for the extended questionnaire. 

The scope of the questionnaire includes:
- Education (Basic and Extended)
- Employment (Basic and Extended)

Data collection occurred concurrently with a UNHCR registration verification exercise. Registration records were updated for all households in the settlement. A systematic random sample was then selected for an extended SEP interview. Those who were not selected for the extended interview were administered a shorter, basic version of the questionnaire. For this survey, a stratified single-stage sample design was applied. The sample was implicitly stratified for the three villages in the settlement. For the Basic SEP, all households in the settlement are selected and the selection probability is 1. For the Extended SEP, a targeted sample size of 1500 households was required to obtain a 15 percent difference in the poverty rates of 2 groups in the sample at a confidence level of 95 percent and a power of 80 percent. To randomly select these households, a straight forward approach was used to select these households from registered proGres families before the exercise. Thus, households that received the extended SEP were randomly determined before the start of the survey using the tablet. The sample of the extended survey alone is representative and therefore sufficient for generating poverty estimates headline indicators for the population as a whole.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted between 20 August and 8 September 2018 in the 3 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo and Hagadera) to assess the magnitude and severity of malnutrition, assess trends by comparison with previous years and support programmatic decisions.

The weighted prevalence of global acutemalnutrition, the most important indicator, was 8.0% overall, falling within the POOR category (5-9%). However, there was a marked improvement from 9.7% in 2017. Only Ifo camp was within the SERIOUS category (10-14%). The high prevalence of anaemia remains a major concern, as shown by the anaemia prevalence among children which remained above the 40% critical threshold, despite having decreased. Anaemia prevalence among non-pregnant women jumped to 48.9% overall, from 43.6% in 2017 and was above the 40% threshold for all camps. Some improvement was recorded in terms of infant and young chid feeding indicators, although there is still room for improvement. The access to safe drinking water also continued to be satisfactory, while gaps were still observed in terms of sanitation.

The 2-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters from each of the 3 camps. At the first stage, a list of blocks was made before the required number were selected using sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) using ENA softwareIn nearly all cases, a cluster was the equivalent of a block. However, there were exceptions where, for some larger blocks, more than 1 cluster was selected. In this case, the blocks were split further to cater for more than one cluster. In the event that a selected block had more than 250 households, according to SMART guidance, segmentation was done, after which one of the segments was randomly selected to be the cluster.

All households in the selected clusters were labelled before data collection. At the second stage, the required number of households were selected using systematic random sampling from a list of households. A random number was selected between 1 and the sampling interval, which was calculated by dividing the total number of households in the cluster with the required number of households. The selected number became the first household to be surveyed. Subsequent households were selected by adding the sampling interval until the required number of households were completed. All eligible children below 5 years of age from all selected households were surveyed for the Child Anthropometry and Health, and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), and WASH.

The refugee complex of Dadaab is home to an estimate of 208,000 registered refugees of which the vast majority are Somalis who fled conflict and drought in their home country several decades ago. The Dadaab refugee complex is situated in northeastern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in the year 1991 following the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. Somalis were forced to flee as the war worsened, leaving to neighbouring countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. Today, Dadaab is home to refugees from many countries in eastern and central Africa, including South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Somali refugees make up more than 90% of the population. Until early 2017, it consisted of five refugee camps. However, one of the camps, Kambioos, which was also the newest, was closed in March 2017 as refugees began returning to Somalia and the few remaining moved into the other camps. Ifo 2 camp was closed in May 2018 in line with the cam consolidation approach, with refugees either moving to the other camps or being repatriated voluntarily. Refugees live in mud-walled houses with iron sheeting roofs, while some, especially new arrivals, live in tents. 

The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) was conducted in the 4 Dadaab refugee camps (Dagahaley, Ifo, Ifo 2 and Hagadera) between 28 August and 23 September 2017 by nutrition partners (MSF-Switzerland, Islamic Relief Kenya, International Rescue Committee and Kenya Red Cross) with overall coordination by UNHCR supported by WFP.
 
After the increase in the prevalence of GAM observed in 2016 (10.2% weighted prevalence of GAM in all camps from 8.1% in 2015), the 2017 SENS indicated weigthed prevalence of GAM 9.7% which is close to what it was in 2016. The difference between the weighted prevalence of GAM in all the camps in 2016 and 2017 is not statistically significant. However, its to be mentioned that the prevalence of GAM in Dagahaley, Hagdera, and Ifo 2 camp is 8.3%, 8.6%, and 9.4% which is classified as POOR nutrition sitation, while in Ifo camp its 12.7% classified as SERIOUS nutrition sitaition as per the WHO classiciation of the public health significance. Overall, weighted anaemia prevalence showed a sharp increase among children aged 6-59 months to 60.7%, up from 49.7% in 2016. This is well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold) and requires attention. In all camps, anaemia was well above the 40% of public health significance (critical threshold). The children 6-23 age group had the highest prevalence of anaemia; however, the prevalence in the children 24-35 age group was also very concerning as it was above the critical threshold in all camps.",2017-08-28-2017-09-2,"Children 0-23 months

- Women 15-49: all eligible women in every other household were assessed. 

The 2-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 30 clusters from each of the 3 camps. At the first stage, a list of blocks was made before the required number were selected using sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) using ENA softwareIn nearly all cases, a cluster was the equivalent of a block. However, there were exceptions where, for some larger blocks, more than 1 cluster was selected. In this case, the blocks were split further to cater for more than one cluster. In the event that a selected block had more than 250 households, according to SMART guidance, segmentation was done, after which one of the segments was randomly selected to be the cluster.

All households in the selected clusters were labelled before data collection. At the second stage, the required number of households were selected using systematic random sampling from a list of households. A random number was selected between 1 and the sampling interval, which was calculated by dividing the total number of households in the cluster with the required number of households. The selected number became the first household to be surveyed. Subsequent households were selected by adding the sampling interval until the required number of households were completed. All eligible children below 5 years of age from all selected households were surveyed for the Child Anthropometry and Health, and Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), and WASH. Half of the selected households were selected for the Food Security and Women questionnaire. The survey respondents were the primary caretakers of children below 5 years. Abandoned households were not included in the sampling frame. Absent households or households where children were absent were re-visited before the end of the day.

The calculation was based on the expected prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children, 6-59 months. A precision of 3.5; a design effect (DEFF) of 1.5 for Kakuma and 1 for Kalobeyei; an average household size of 6.6 in Kakuma and 5.2 in Kalobeyei; and, percentage of children under the age of five was estimated at 19.5% in Kakuma and 14.9% in Kalobeyei, using the UNHCR ProGres data, November 2019.

ENA for SMART selects the clusters (blocks), once done a team was sent to a block to label the households numerically with indelible pens. Population density varies across the blocks at Kakuma. If a block contained 100 households or less, all households in the block were marked. If a Block contained more than 100 households then the team walked around the block to identify a path that divided the block into approximately two halves. One portion of the block was selected randomly. In the selected segment of the block the team proceeded to number all households from the first to the last.

It was conducted in the two counties of Kilifi and Kwale on the coast, north and south of Mombasa, respectively. According to information from village elders familiar with the Pemba community in Kenya, most of the Pemba population resides in these two counties. While there are some Pemba residents in Lamu, the security situation prevented data collection there. Further, a few Pemba are believed to live in the city of Mombasa and elsewhere in the country. But due to lack of further information, no data were collected in Mombasa or elsewhere. 
The objectives of the full survey, conducted in August 2016, were:

The mapping was done from 4 to 12 August 2016 by a team from UNHCR Kenya office and KNBS. 
The mapping in each village commenced with a visit to the chief's office, who put the team in touch with the village chair. The team explained the purpose of its visit to the village chair and began the mapping exercise. The importance of involving the chiefs and village chairpersons is that they are well connected, recognised and trusted by residents in their communities. The same procedure is followed by KNBS when they are mapping for sample surveys and censuses.
The team established physical boundaries of the area to be mapped, located the boundaries on the map and then identified and listed the Pemba households within the enumeration boundary.  A Pemba household, in this context, is one identified by the informants as having at least one person with origins or links to Pemba. The links may include a person's spouse, parents or grandparents, who migrated to Kenya from Pemba or where a person has migrated from Pemba to Kenya. 
The mapping team was followed by the village chair to the Pemba households, where the UNHCR and Haki Centre staff listed number of persons in each, while the KNBS staff marked the location of the household on the map. The entrances of identified Pemba households were marked in chalk with the letters HCR and a number starting at 001 to make it easier to find the houses during the enumeration. Since it seems to be generally well known where the Pemba live it was not considered stigmatising to mark their doors. During the feedback forums with the Pemba after the survey, there was no mention of stigmatization due to marking the door with chalk. 
The maps were from the 2009 national housing and population census, purchased from KNBS. The team made lists with information about the location, number and size of each household. The mapping team visited 17 villages in Kilifi and Kwale (see Table 1 in Section 2.7). All villages visited were identified before the mapping exercise by key informants as locations being home to the Pemba of Kenya. The key informants were Pemba elders in different sub-counties previously identified for providing background information on the Pemba arrival and history in Kenya. In each sub-country, the chief, the assistant chief or the village chair also accompanied the team.

Against the background of ever-limited resources and recognizing that the refugee population is not homogeneously vulnerable, in mid-2021 WFP and UNHCR initiated the shift to the targeted provision of food assistance based on needs.
  A targeting strategy – developed by UNHCR and WFP with support from the Joint UNHCR-WFP Programme Excellence and Targeting Hub - was formulated with the following objectives:
- Identify vulnerable refugee households in need of humanitarian assistance and less vulnerable refugees with higher livelihood resilience who would benefit from livelihoods support;
- Ensure the greatest protection outcomes through strong community participation, communications with refugee communities and risk analysis to inform the approach.
  This second JPDM has served to ensure that the corporate practice of post-distribution monitoring is fulfilled. Additionally, it assessed the extent to which the targeting approach has – over a period of five months between May and September 2021 – achieved the above objectives.

  In addition, to better understand the vulnerability status of households receiving various assistance since the targeting started, the sampling of the 2nd JPDM was also designed to be representative at the assistance group level. Same as the first JPDM, the assessment team used the total number of ProGres Groups by the time the survey was designed (August 2021) as the most reliable proxy to the total number of households, hence the sample frame. The sample size was planned to reach (a minimum of) 2,400 households in total with 95% confidence level and 5% margin error while factoring a 15% non-response rate. The distribution of the households by camp and by eligibility group was proportional to the distribution of number of the total population in each stratification.

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

A probabilistic sampling approach was used for IDPs from Somaliland, refugee returnees, economic migrants and host community living in settlements. The sample in the settlements was stratified by population group and was representative at the total population level. The distribution of each population group was proportionate to their size in each settlement and was considered when distributing the sample across the settlements. For the IDPs from South Central Somalia and refugees/asylum seekers, a non- probabilistic sampling approach was adopted due to the relatively small size of these population groups and scattered distribution in the urban area of Hargeisa. For the IDPs originating from south- central Somalia and residing in the urban areas of Hargeisa outside of the known settlements, the profiling deployed respondent- driven sampling, whereby the individuals being surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know. In turn, the next individuals surveyed referred the data collectors to people they know, and so forth (snowball sampling). Therefore, results cannot be generalised to the total population, but can give a good indication of the situation of the SC IDPs living outside of settlements.

UNHCR population figures from ProGres were used to determine the total population and that of children 6-59 months for survey planning purposes. At the end of August 2019, the Gorom refugee population was 2347 individuals. 395 (16.8%) of these were children under five years. 
An exhaustive survey was conducted in relation to children as the total population size of Gorom camp was below 2,500 people rendering sampling unnecessary following UNHCR SENS guideline. All children aged 6-59 months in the camp were surveyed. 

A total of six survey teams composed of four members each (one team leader, one haemoglobin measurer, one anthropometric measurer/translator and one anthropometric/haemoglobin measurement assistant were included in each survey. A standardized training lasting five days, which included a standardization test was provided. Data collection lasted five days. The survey teams were supported by a team of 2 supervisors and 1 coordinator who roved between the teams duration the data collection. 

Mobile phone questionnaires using Open Data Kit (ODK) android software was used for data collection for all the modules. Data validation was carried out daily by the survey coordinator, which allowed for daily feedback to the survey teams. Data analysis was carried out using ENA for SMART July 9th, 2015 version for anthropometric indices and Epi info version 7 for all the other data.",2019-09-16-2019-09-2,"Children 0-23 months

UNHCR in collaboration with AHA, IRC and WFP carried out the nutrition survey in Pamir and Ajoung Thok refugee camps from 21 to 31 October 2019. Pamir and Ajoung Thok are the official refugee camps in Pariang County, Unity State. No nutrition survey was carried out in Yida as comprehensive services were not provided in 2019 considering its exit strategy. Refugees from Yida continue to be relocated to Pamir and
Ajoung Thok refugee camps. The overall aim of the survey was to assess the nutrition situation among the refugee population and to monitor ongoing programme interventions. In each of the camps a cross- sectional survey was conducted using the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) version 2, 2013 guidelines (http://sens.unhcr.org/) and the Standardised Monitoring and Assessments of Relief and Transitions (SMART) guidelines (https://smartmethodology.org/). Systematic random sampling was used to identify the survey respondents.

The surveys had a total of 4 modules consisting of 3 individual level and 1 household level questionnaires following UNHCR SENS guidelines version 2, 2013. The modules included: 
1. Anthropometry and health targeting all children aged 6 to 59 months in all the sampled households; 
2. Anaemia targeting all children aged 6 to 59 months in all the sampled households and all non-pregnant women aged 15 to 49 years in every other sampled household, 
3. Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) targeting all children aged 0 to 23 months in all the sampled households; 
4. Food security targeting every other sampled household. 

The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and mosquito net coverage modules were not carried out. This is because there is a WASH monitoring system in place and WASH Knowledge Attitude and Practices (KAP) assessment was conducted within the same month as the nutrition survey. Information on mosquito net coverage was carried out within the year in Pamir and Ajoung Thok in a separate partner assessment. The Emergency Nutrition Assessment (ENA) software version July 9th, 2015 was used to calculate the sample sizes of children and households for participating in the survey.

A total of six survey teams composed of four members each (one team leader, one hemoglobin measurer, one anthropometric measurer/translator and one hemoglobin/anthropometric measurement assistant) were included in each survey. A standardized training lasting five days, which included a standardization test was provided. Data collection lasted eight days from 21-31 October with a two days break on the 26 and 27 October 2019. The survey teams were supported by a team of 5 supervisors and 3 coordinators who roved between the  teams during the data collection.

Mobile phone questionnaires using Open Data Kit (ODK) android software was used for data collection for the four modules of SENS.

There are over 2.2 million refugees spread across Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the Central African Republic (CAR) a further 1.8 million people are displaced internally in South Sudan. An estimated 140,000 South Sudanese spontaneously returnees are reported to have returned to South Sudan from November 2018 to date.

The South Sudan situation continues to be characterized as a children's tragedy with children constituting over 65 percent of the refugee population. The Revitalised Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) foresees the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU) with all the parties in agreement including the leader of the SPLA IO and first vice president by May 2019.

In November 2018, it was agreed during the Kampala Representatives meeting that intention surveys should be conducted for South Sudanese refugees in all countries of asylum. This was further concretized in March 2019, during the EHA/GLR planning meeting; here it was decided that UNHCR country representations of CAR, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Sudan, Ethiopia would ensure that a rapid intention survey of South Sudanese refugees in their respective asylum countries is carried out before May 2019, in line with the agreed calendar of the R-ARCSS

The Intention Survey was a cross-sectional survey conducted among the over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees living in six countries of asylum using a stratified random sampling approach to survey 6,964 refugees (heads of households) in 15 camps selected across the region. In each location, sample size estimation assumed a 95 per cent confidence level, and a margin of error of 7 per cent; sample was drawn taking into account the location, place of origin, ethnicity, year of arrival to the country of asylum and gender of the head of household. The confidence intervals were taken into consideration in all the tables and analysis. Security, access and logistical constraints restricted sampling in some locations, therefore weighting was applied to adjust for unequal selection probabilities in each of the 15 locations. The findings of this report are representative of the return intentions of refugee households in these 15 camps. Data was collected through in-person interviews using a harmonised survey that was conducted concurrently in the six countries in May 2019 with a mobile data collection tool (KoBo Toolkit).

In 2020, an estimated 2.5 million people were internally displaced and close to 400,000 Darfuris refugees resided in neighbouring countries. The political transition following years of conflict paved the way for the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA) in 2020. The peace agreement aims to address the root causes of conflict but also establishes durable solutions for displaced populations as a necessity for lasting peace in Darfur. In 2021, the Government furthermore initiated work on a National Strategy on Solutions, which will offer a critical strategic framework and operational roadmap towards solutions for displaced communities in Sudan. 
In 2017, the Government of Sudan (GoS) and the international community agreed on the need to collectively support Durable Solutions for IDPs, returnees, and their host communities to end the situation of protracted displacement. The collaboration on Durable Solutions between the GoS and international community resulted in two Durable Solution pilots in respectively El Fasher (North Darfur) and Um Dukhun (Central Darfur). JIPS provided technical support for the scale-up of the durable solutions analysis across Darfur under the Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF). 
Focusing on nine localities, including urban areas, the data collection exercises build directly on the durable solutions analysis approach piloted in El Fasher in 2019. The Durable Solutions Working Group (DSWG) identified a joint evidence base and a collaborative approach as priorities and therefore undertook a joint area-based profiling exercise, focusing on the Abu Shouk and El Salaam IDP camps on the outskirts of El Fasher. 
The focus was set on profiling of IDPs (in camp settlements and out of camps), IDP returnees, refugee returnees, and non-displaced. The profiling exercises are aimed at: 
i.Informing CERF programming and Action Plan development in each state/locality;

The sampling followed a stratified multi-stage sampling approach in which villages were the primary sampling unit (PSU) and households were the secondary sampling unit (SSU), while stratification was done by target group. Accordingly, the first sampling stage consisted of selecting a sample of villages with probabilities that were proportional to size; villages with higher numbers of households had a higher probability of being selected for the survey. A random sample of households was then selected based on two approaches: systematic skips or systematic snowballing. This depended on the spatial distribution of the target groups in each
village. For example, in all camps and return villages where only IDPs reside, systematic skips were done. In villages with more target groups, systematic snowballing was performed for each target group.

Sampling limitations & specifications
- The sampling is designed to produce results representative for each target group in the locality. Analysis at the village level is not possible and therefore no reference to villages or breakdown by villages is done in the report.
- The locations targeted for the survey were not selected randomly across the localities and thus do not necessarily provide representative results of all settlement situations in the localities. The targeting of location has been based on a conflict sensitive approach and the programmatic scope of the PBF. However, the area level analysis has looked at locality as a whole and thus ounterbalance the survey scope which focused on the displaced target groups.",Face-to-face interview: Mobile,NA,NA,"PBF Sudan, DSWG Sudan, UNHCR, JIPS (2021).

The commitment is rooted in the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) from 2011, signed by the Government of Sudan, other major parties to the conflict and the international community, and which sets out the framework for peace in Darfur. The peace agreement and the Darfur Development Strategy (DDS) that followed constitute political commitments to support durable peace and development in Darfur. This pledge has resulted in piloting a durable solutions process in El Fasher in North Darfur.
To reach durable solutions and end displacement, long-term planning based on agreed and jointly-owned comprehensive data is needed. To establish an agreed evidence base, a collaborative profiling approach was adopted that brought actors together to ensure trust and ownership of the results of the profiling exercise. An important aspect of this durable solutions profiling is that it places IDPs centre-stage alongside the two other major stakeholdersthe Government of Sudan and the international communitypermitting the profiling results and recommendations to be owned and signed off by all parties. The durable solutions profiling exercise in El Fasher makes up step two: getting better informed about the displacement affected communities in the five-stage durable solutions process. The survey included 3002 households. It specifically aims to:  provide a comprehensive profile of IDPs residing in Abu Shouk and El Salaam IDP camps; develop a better understanding of IDPs vulnerabilities, coping mechanisms, capacities and provide insight into IDPs perceptions and their future settlement intentions; provide a jointly agreed upon data set to help inform durable solutions programming responses;  pilot a profiling exercise of displacement and joint durable solutions planning that could be replicated in other Sudan contexts with displaced populations.",2018-05-01-2018-07-3,Household and individual,N/A,NA,"The survey includes the following topics:

The four strata were divided into clusters of similar population size, based on a grid developed on a map of the areas. Clusters were selected from each stratum with a uniform probability of selection. The sampling was conducted in this manner, because there was no reliable population data available which would have made sampling probabilities to size possible. All the households in the selected enumeration areas were listed, while 12 were selected for interviews in each cluster in simple random draws. The listing exercise resulted in a significantly lower number of clusters than was planned. To compensate for the lower number of clusters, some of the listed clusters were selected for oversampling.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

Despite facing its own economic challenges, for decades Tanzania has welcomed thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring countries of Great Lakes Region. The counties geographic proximity to the strife-torn Congo Basin is responsible in part for the ease access of displaced populations. As well Tanzania was an early signatory in the region to international agreements on the rights and welfare of refugee and asylum seekers.
 
As of December, 2018, Tanzania host some 284,300 camp-based refugees, 77% of who are children and woman, in Nduta, Nyarugusu and Mtendeli Refugee Camps in Kigoma region in Northwest Tanzania. About 74% are from Burundi, and the remaining 26% are primarily from Democratic republic of Congo. 

Following a Tripartite Commission meeting in August 2017, the governments of Tanzania, Burundi, and UNHCR agreed to assist refugees who wish to voluntarily repatriate from Tanzania to Burundi. A subsequent meeting in March 2018 reaffirmed the commitment of both governments and UNHCR to uphold the principle of voluntariness, and noted that while some refugees may opt to return, others will continue to be in need of international protection. The March 2018 Tripartite meeting also produced a work plan entailing the repatriation of approximately 2,000 refugees per week from 5 April to 31 December 2018. As from January to 30th September 2018, a total of 52,260 refugees were assisted to voluntarily repatriate to Burundi from Tanzania in 88 Convoys; bringing the total repatriated from September 2017 to 57,865 of which 57.2% are children.

Currently there are three refugee camps namely Nyarugusu (comprising of Old and New Camps) located in Kasulu, Nduta in Kibondo district and Mtendeli in Kakonko district. 
The oldest refugee camp is Nyarugusu which has been hosting refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi since 1996. Refugees from Burundi were repatriated voluntarily in 2012 leading to closure of some of the existing camps. The remainder population in need of protection were relocated to Nyarugusu camp where the total population then was about 65,000 as of early April 2015 majority being Congolese refugees and other minority nationalities such as Rwandese, Sudanese, Ugandans, and Kenyans. 

The refugee situation changed in 2015 following the political instability after the general elections in Burundi leading exodus of some Burundians to Tanzania and other neighbouring countries. As from late April 2015 higher numbers of refugees from Burundi started arriving in Tanzania mainly through a tiny border village along Lake Tanganyika and other entry points in Kigoma region. After the influx, the total population increased causing congestion in Nyarugusu camp calling for the re-opening two camps; Nduta camp on the 7th October 2015 and Mtendeli camp on 14th January 2016. 
Nyarugusu currently hosts Congolese refugees (Old Camp) and 39.4% of the Burundi refugees (New Camp) who arrived at the onset of the emergency. Nduta hosts an estimated population of 123,673 refugees who were relocated from Nyarugusu and Mtendeli hosts 52,004 who were relocated from Nyarugusu and is still receiving the new arrivals. According to UNHCR ProGres data August 2017, the total number of refugees in Kigoma Region is estimated to be 310,735.

Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.

Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).

Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. 
Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.

Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. 

Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin. Similarly, internal movement within Uganda and opportunities to migrate to a new country are areas in which refugees say they lack guidance from humanitarian agencies or other actors.",2019-10-08-2019-10-3,Individuals and households,N/A,Sample survey data [ssd],Admission and rights; emergency response and ongoing needs; resilience and self-reliance; expanded solutions; voluntary repatriation; demographics.,Ground Truth Solutions,"This survey is the third round of questions Ground Truth Solutions has asked in Uganda; the first round took place in 2017 and the second in 2018. As in previous rounds, respondents to the current round of questions have been selected randomly, but the respondents themselves are different from those in previous rounds. When designing the sampling strategy for this survey, we used the most recent figures for populations of refugees from the UNHCR refugee portal. Based on this data, we decided to focus on South Sudanese and Congolese refugees, as they made up 92% of all the refugees in Uganda at the time. Refugees from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia each made up 0-3% of the overall refugee population and were excluded from this study. This is not to say that the perspectives of more marginal groups are not important, but rather that gathering these perspectives was simply beyond the scope of our research in view of the geographical and time constraints involved. In terms of the locations selected, we decided to include Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja (and to exclude Kampala, Lobule, Oruchinga, and Palabek), as over 90% of South Sudanese and Congolese refugees reside in these refugee settlements, according to UNHCR's most recent figures. 

The actual sample size achieved was 1,511 participants from 10 refugee settlements across Uganda, and the sample size in each settlement was proportional to the population size of the targeted communities within any given settlement. Using a confidence level of 95%, this sample size affords an expected margin of error of 3%. 

Ground Truth Solutions co-led enumerator training and supervised data collection on the ground. Within each of the 10 selected settlements, we chose particular zones from which to collect data, and within these zones, we selected smaller village/cluster units. In selecting the zones, we grouped them into two or three tiers, depending on the population size within the given zones of the camp, and asked the data collection partner to select one zone from each tier in order to capture responses from differently sized areas. Within the zones, a GTS supervisor, in consultation with local leaders and actors on the ground, selected the villages/clusters based on several factors, such as when they were established, their distance from central points, and their population size.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Survey questions were developed to help understand refugees’ perceptions of the aid they receive, their relationship with humanitarian workers and the host community, and their future prospects. For the purpose of comparing this data with previous rounds, the questions in this round are phrased similarly to those in rounds one and two wherever possible. We consulted local actors and organisations in Uganda for feedback and input during the survey question design phase. Draft questions were also presented to UNHCR, the Assessment Technical Working Group (ATWG), the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), and the Office of the Prime Minister.

The influxes particularly from South Sudan, Burundi and DRC over the past 3 years currently renders Uganda the biggest host for refugees in Africa.

In order to efficiently offer adequate aid to these refugees, more and more humanitarian organizations and international non-governmental organizations have decided to convert in-kind support to cash-based transfers. These transfers are provided to people with special needs, such as pregnant women and the elderly, or to refugees taking part in 'cash for work' programmes (e.g., constructing community rubbish pits, building access roads, working on farms or planting trees).

The report also incorporates findings on needs among refugee and host community populations living in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The findings and analysis from this report has been used to support the Refugee Response Plan for 2019-2020, along with informing other programmatic, strategic, and operational decision making for the humanitarian response coordinators and partner organisations. The JMSNA aims to compare humanitarian needs across population groups and locations in order to highlight groups and areas of most concern. Consequently, it aims to answer the following research question: what is the situation for specific population groups (refugees residing within refugee settlements and host community populations) in Uganda regarding health and nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); livelihoods, environment and energy; shelter, site planning, and non-food items; education; and food security.

The JMSNA process in Uganda began in February 2018, with REACH facilitating the research design under the auspices of UNHCR and Uganda’s Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). Through the inter-agency coordination group and other coordination mechanisms, a collaborative tool was developed with input from many partners. Data collection was conducted from 2 April to 14 July, 2018, in all 30 refugee settlements. Data collection was carried out in Kampala from 6 to 16 March and 28 March to 9 April to assess the needs of refugee and host community households in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

Between April and June 2015 UNHCR installed some three dozen community lights in 50% of Rhino Camp’s 14 villages. As demand for community lighting far exceeded available funds, UNHCR worked with the refugee community and its partner the Danish Refugee Council to prioritize the strategic placement of lights within villages. The partners jointly selected locations where (1) refugees were prone to nighttime violence, theft or other safety risks, and (2) lights would promote constructive night-time activity.

Using a 72-question survey, researchers asked respondents what day- and night-time6 activities they and their children do, and whether they do these activities in lit or unlit locations. Researchers then asked respondents if they feared or had been victims of something bad while doing these activities. The phrase something bad is the English translation for the most commonly used expressions – in Nuer, Dinka, Bari, and Kiswahili – of being a victim of an aggressive act or encountering danger.

The sample design for the study was multi-stage with the first stage covering the primary sampling units (PSUs) which was a sample of clusters developed during the 1999 census. The second stage was selection of households within the clusters. A re-listing of all households in sampled clusters was carried out to up-date the 1999 and also to be able to classify households into the three strata of interest in this study: international migrant households, internal migrant households, and non-migrant households. At the household level, interviews were held with the household head/spouse or other responsible adult with the requisite information about the household. 
The study uses a purposive survey methodology that first selected districts with the largest concentration of international migrants, and then selected clusters also with the highest concentration of international migrants. This was done based on the information of previous household surveys and the knowledge of the administrative officers, statistical officers and cluster guides. 

Sampling Frame
At the time of the study, the available National Census was conducted in 1999. This census did not contain questions on remittances but had questions on migration.  The migration question asked then was where family members were living in the last one year.  This means that the census captured either those who had come back or those who had come visiting and were to return to where they migrated to.  It did not distinguish clearly the migration component.  Further, the census was conducted 10 years ago which meant it does not provide the current status on aspects of migration. The Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) 2005/06 and the Financial Services Deepening survey (FSD) are two surveys that have recently been conducted with an element of migration and remittances.  However, the information is not adequate for the current survey.  For example, the KIHBS has a question that captures issues of remittance linking them to the transfers received from abroad.  Although it has about 13,000 households, only about 125 households indicated they had received such transfers.  This was a very small sample compared to what was envisaged by the current study.  The Financial Services Deepening survey (FSD) (2006/07) also has a question on cash transfers from abroad but all this is related to issues of access to financial services and not to issues sought in the current study.  Thus, it could not be used for the current study.  The KIHBS and FSD surveys was based on the KNBS NASSEP IV and although one may have thought of revisiting the households that were covered for additional information, it is against the KNBS regulations to conduct such follow-ups and the households identities are not provided.
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics household survey sampling frame, the National Sample Survey and Evaluation Programme (NASSEP IV), is based on the 1999 population and housing census.  The objective of NASSEP IV frame was to construct a national master sampling frame of clusters of households in both rural and urban areas in Kenya using a sound sampling design.  This sampling frame has a total of 1,800 clusters of which 1,260 are rural and 540 are urban as indicated in Appendix Table 1.  Each cluster holds about 80 to 100 households.  The framework is based on the old administrative units comprising of 69 districts in 8 Provinces.  Currently, the districts have been subdivided and increased to 265 but this does not distort our sampling frame based on NASSEP IV as the new districts are curved out of the old districts.

The Sample
This study utilized the NASSEP IV frame to select 102 clusters (5.6% of the total clusters) in 19 districts which yielded a total sample of 2,448 households assuming an average of 24 households in each cluster.  The districts were selected first, then the clusters in each district and finally the households in each cluster.  Households in each cluster were re-listed (updated) and grouped into three strata--international migrant, internal migrant and non-migrant households.  In the selection of clusters in each district, at least one of the targeted five clusters was urban with exception of Nairobi and Mombasa which are purely urban.
The study however ended up covering 92 clusters (5.1% of the total clusters in NASSEP IV) from 17 districts. Two targeted districts-Kajiado and Baringo- were not covered due to logistical problems.  First of all, the team was expected to finalize the field by 15th December so that the analysis could begin and be on time.  When the fieldwork was winding up on 22nd December, the two districts were yet to be covered.  Two, the two districts have more transport challenges and the team was therefore expected to use KNBS transport facilities and more research assistants to capture the households which are more widely spread on the ground.  This required adequate funding and by the time the fieldwork was winding up no funds had been received from World Bank.  Third, even when the funds were received in January, the team considered that the study would be capturing households in a different consumption cycle, having just gone through the festive season.  Given all these factors, this saw a total of 2,123 household covered out of 2, 208 (96% of the total targeted). Of these, some households were later dropped due to a lot of missing data especially due to non response, and at the end a total of 1,942 households were cleaned up for analysis. This including 953 are urban and 989 rural drawn from 51 rural and 40 urban clusters.
Selection of Districts
There was a particular interest in investigating households that had international migrants and which may have received transfers from abroad. A random sample of the population would not produce adequate number of households that had received transfers or had international migration, as we learnt from the KIHBS data set.  As indicated earlier, out of 13,000 households surveyed under KIHBS only 125 households receiving remittances from abroad.  With this experience and information, this study selected the top nineteen districts from KIHBS (2005/07) that showed households with migration characteristics.  The key factor used was that the households indicated they received cash transfers from abroad. Districts with more than one household fulfilling this criterion of having received transfers from abroad were considered. In addition, Financial Services Deepening survey (FSD) survey results were used to confirm that the selected districts had reported having received money from abroad.  In addition, since this is a relatively rare phenomenon in Kenya, the selection of districts is designed such that households with the relevant characteristics have a high probability of being selected. As such those districts with a presence of cash transfers mechanisms such as M-PESA, Western Union, or Money Gram services were considered.  All these information was used to update the information from KIHBS. 

Selection of Clusters
In each district, 5 clusters were selected of which at least one cluster was an urban cluster as defined by KNBS, except for Nairobi and Mombasa which are purely urban.  Some other district had more than one urban cluster selected based on their number of clusters and accessibility to rural clusters for example Garissa.  The study covered 10 clusters in Nairobi and 6 in Mombasa with an attempt made to capture this across various income group levels.  
In selection of the clusters, the supervisors sat down with the KNBS statistics officers, cluster guides, village elders, administrative officers (Chiefs and sub-chiefs) to map out clusters where the probability of getting an international migrant was high.  Of this probabilities were very subjective as it was based on how well these people understood the composition of the households in the areas they represent.  This helped to identify the five clusters targeted for study.

Selection of Households
The selection process involved re-listing of the households in each cluster so as to update the list of occupied households and identify the three groups of households.  Each group or stratum was treated as an independent sub-frame and random sampling was used to select households in each group.   The listing exercise was facilitated by the respective District Statistical Officer (DSO).  An instrument was developed to capture the basic characteristics of households in terms of household headship, number of members, and whether contain international or internal migrants and number.
A total of 24 households per cluster were targeted for selection for interview making a minimum of 120 households in each district except Mombasa and Nairobi.  Experience on the ground was different and this saw variations on the household selected in the sample.  The factors considered included availability of international migrants and a rule that in each cluster a maximum of 10 non-migrant households were surveyed (the expected rule was 10 non-migrants, 7 local migrants and 7 international migrant).  However due to the rarity of international migrants, in the sampling process, international migrants were given a priority so that in each cluster almost all were included in the sample.
In the re-listing exercise, households were assigned identification numbers.  When the number of households listed in a stratum exceeds the number to be sampled, households in that stratum were selected randomly.  However, the procedure results in unequal selection probabilities of households in the three strata, which needs to be kept track of through the supervisor sampling sheets.
For the identification of the respondent household and clusters, the NASSEP IV sampling frame had adequately documented facilitating identification of selected clusters and households on the ground.  Each cluster had a map and a listing of the households within it.  The maps indicate the location of the structures and the households.  This enabled the interviewers reach the selected household.",Face-to-face [f2f],"· Questionnaire was designed by the World Bank; updated and contextualized by the research team School of Economics University of Nairobi
· Tested in a pilot survey conducted in Nairobi
· Language of design was English. Enumerators however came from the local areas covered in the survey and were trained to elicit information as contained in the questionnaire in local languages 

The survey questionnaire has 7 sections. Every question is important, and should be completed as fully and accurately as possible.  The goal is to collect the BEST possible information from household respondents on each and every question.  All answers are to be recorded on the actual survey questionnaire.  Each household member is assigned an ID and this ID remains the same throughout the questionnaire.  In other words, the ID of a household member does NOT change from one section of the questionnaire to another. 

COVER SHEET
The cover sheet asks for basic information on the household, such as location of household, name of household head, village/town and enumeration area.  It is very important to fill this cover sheet out correctly, so that – if some information is incorrect - the household can be located again.  

SECTION 1:  HOUSEHOLD ROSTER
This section collects basic demographic data on each and every member of the household. It is VERY important that this section be completed accurately and completely.  

SECTION 2:  HOUSEHOLD CONDITIONS
Section 2 collects information on household conditions and characteristics. Please interview the main person responsible for each dwelling.  In this section there is only one response for each household.   The Q2.1 asks for the tenure status of the dwelling whereas Q2.2 and Q2.3 ask about its construction and the material of its exterior walls. Information on cooking room and the total number of rooms are in Q2.4 and Q2.5. The last questions in this section ask about the presence of electricity and the source of drinking water for the household.

SECTION 3:  HOUSEHOLD ASSETS AND EXPENDITURE
Section 3 is VERY important because it collects information on the assets and expenditures of the household. The goal of this section is to understand the current welfare status of the household, that is, is the household rich or poor.  

SECTION 4: USE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES
Section 4 collects information on the household use of financial services. The purpose of this section is to see if households with migrants and remittances tend to use banks more often than households without migrants. 

SECTION 5: MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES FROM FORMER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS
Section 5 collects information on internal and international migration and remittances from former household members who are currently living outside of the household.  “Former household members” here means any person who used to live in the household, but is CURRENTLY living away from the household in another place within the country OR in another country.  The person who is CURRENTLY living outside the household may have moved away for the purposes of work, marriage, education, or other reason.  

SECTION 6: MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES FROM NON-HOUSEHOLD HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS
Section 6 collects information on internal and international remittances received from non-household members.  In other words, households without migrants may well receive remittances from friends, relatives and other people who are not members of their households. Households without migrants can also receive remittances from people for the repayment of loans or debts.

SECTION 7:  RETURN MIGRANTS
Section 7 collects information on household members who used to live in another part of the country OR in another country, and have since returned to the household to live.  For the purposes of this survey, these people are defined as “return migrants.”  “Return migrants” here include all members of the household who used to live outside of the household for at least 3 months during the last 5 years, and have since returned to the household to live.",NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The 2002 population and housing census provided a frame for sample selection. The frame contains a list of all administrative units up to the lowest level called, 'Local Council 1', or LC1. This is usually, but not always consistent with a village in terms of area. The Enumeration Area (EA) may comprise of one village/LC1, or more than one village/LC1. The demarcation of EAs is based on total population within a given area and in many instances, may vary by locality. In addition the sampling frame also indicates the EA to which a particular LC belongs. The 2002 Uganda Sampling Frame has a total of 33,283 EAs. 

Study population

The study population comprised of the entire population of Uganda. Based on the distribution of households in table 1 above, the sample was determined based on information from Uganda National Household survey 2005/06 conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics.  The proportion of internal migrants reported in the past 5 years has been used to estimate the required sample. Given the limited nature of the number of international migrants, the proportion of internal migrants is considered adequate to provide sufficient estimates of the indicators of interest.

Sample allocation by region

The above sample was proportionately allocated across the four statistical regions on the basis of the population in each of the regions. There was oversampling for urban population approximately by 5 times. To ease implementation, the regional sample was further disaggregated down to Enumeration Area level. 

Selection of Enumeration Areas

The task was to undertake a nationally-representative survey of 2,000 households (urban and rural combined) in 2009 that would provide information on migration, remittances and their effects on development.
The frame was be divided into two strata namely rural and urban. A two-stage stratified sample design was adopted. The first stage representing the primary sampling unit comprised of the selection of EAs from each of the strata while at the second and ultimate stage households were selected. EAs were selected from the list of Enumeration Areas developed after the 2002 Population and Housing Census and updated to include new districts. 

The selection of EAs was proportionally done based on the number of households in the respective stratum according to the 2006 Uganda household survey. All the EAs in each domain were sorted by county, sub-county and parish. A random number was generated and an appropriate random start and sampling interval was systematically selected from the ordered list with probability proportionate to number of households.  This was done separately for urban and rural areas, hence stratified sampling.  The proportion of EAs sampled in urban areas is about 5 times that in rural.

Selection of households

At the second stage, a complete listing of households in each EA was done to classify the households into three groups: non migrants, internal migrants and international migrants. The number of households per EA varied from around 20 to about 1000. Most of the time, all households were listed even in the large EAs since it was difficult to establish lines of demarcation to segment the EA. 

A total of 10 households were selected randomly from each of the 200 EAs. The goal was to select 4 households with an international migrant (emigrant), 3 with one or more internal migrants, and 3 with no migrant. This sampling was done from the three strata or listings of households according to migration status. Separate sampling was done from each stratum using systematic sampling.  In case of a refusal or other reason for non-response, another household was selected from the same stratum to reach the desired quota.   In case the number of households listed in any of the three strata was smaller than the numbers desired (4, 3, 3), then all those listed in that stratum were automatically sampled and the short fall selected from the next stratum. 

For example, if there were, say, 150 households in an EA, with 3 with international migrants, 27 with internal migrants, and 120 with no migrants, the numbers selected would be, respectively, 3, 3 and 3.  But to make up 10, priority would be given to the migrant stratum to add one more, randomly selected, from that stratum.  As another example, suppose there were 0 international migrant households; then 7 would be selected from the internal migrant stratum and still only 3 from the list of non-migrant households.

The choice of 10 households per EA was based on experience from the various economic surveys conducted by UBOS, where 10 households provide adequate representation at EA level for most of the economic and social indicators. 

The listing operation

The survey targeted household with in-migrants or former members who have migrated away, whether to another part of the country (urban or rural) or to another country. Since the census frame does not uniquely identify who is a migrant or non migrant, and owing to the lack of an up to date list of all households in Uganda from which to draw the sample, the survey team adopted a listing exercise as stop gap measure. 

The exercise involved conducting a fresh listing of all households in each of the selected EAs. During the exercise, households with migrants were identified and the migrants clearly categorized as internal-within Uganda- or international where household members had moved to another country all together. The total number of listed household numbers was 24,618. Thereafter, a sample of 10 households was selected using systematic sampling procedure.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaire consisted of seven sections namely:
A Cover Sheet requiring  household identification particulars including district name and code, county name and code, parish name and code, EA name, stratum, household number, names of the household head and first spouse, number of household members and a description of the location of the household.

In addition, the page captured details of the interview including the interviewer name, date, duration and the outcome of the interview. It also provided for the team leaders remarks and signature.

Section 1: Household roster
This section captured the socio-demographic characteristics of all household members.

Section 2: Households housing conditions
In this section, information was sought on the type of dwelling, occupancy status, the physical characteristics of the dwelling, and access to basic utilities including water, electricity and sanitation.  

Section 3 Household Assets and Expenditure
The section collected information on the assets and expenditures of the household. This information was used to determine the welfare status of the household.

Section 4: Household Use of Financial Services:
In this section, information relating to use of financial services by household members was collected. 

Section 5: Internal and International Migration And Remittances From Former Household Members
This section captured information on migration, both internal and international as well as remittances received by the household from former household member migrants.

Section 6: Internal and International Migration and Remittances From Former Household Members
Like section 5 above, section 6 sought information on migration, both internal and international as well as remittances received by the household from non household member migrants.

Section 7: Return Migrants
Here information on Return migrants was captured. A return migrant was defined as an adult member (over 18 years old) currently living in the household, who had lived in another country or another place in Uganda for at least 3 months in the 5 years preceding the survey.  The information sought in this section related to the last migration episode for each return migrant.","The first stage comprised of total number of households in the listed EAs and the total number of households in the entire frame. The total number of households was used as the measure of size. 

At the second stage, the total number of households listed was used to select the sample of 10 as described above. This fraction constituted the second stage weights.

The product of these two weights, with the appropriate sampling fraction, yielded the final EA/household weights used. (Note that the reciprocal of the weight).","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

The total samples were compiled utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling through respondent selection. Multi-stage random sampling ensured that a random sample of adults was collected in each country. First, after stratifying the population of each country by region and population density, sampling points (SPs) were determined. SPs were then randomly selected within each stratum. At each SP, respondents were randomly selected to participate in the survey.

Phase 1:

The first phase consisted of national surveys of the adult population of each country. The three survey samples were designed to be representative of the adult populations of these three countries. World Bank coordinated and oversaw all aspects of the sampling and interviewing process. A team of local field experts was hired in each country to conduct the actual interviews. All interviewers were professionally trained and supervised by research personnel. In this phase of the research, a total of 2042 Ethiopian adults were interviewed.

Phase 2:

Once the national surveys were completed, the results were analyzed to determine the areas of concentration of the remittance recipient population, after which the second phase of the project was conducted. This phase of the project included a targeted survey of the remittance recipient population of each of the three East African countries. Sampling Points were established based on the analysis of the national survey data and the identification of areas within each country that showed the highest concentrations of remittances received from relatives abroad in proportion to the sample size of all areas surveyed. Once again, local field experts were hired in each country to conduct the interviews, training and supervision of field operations. Languages of interviews were the same as those employed in Phase 1 and, again, all interviews were conducted in person using the PAPI method.

Detail:

The total sample was compiled utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling through respondent selection. This sampling method enabled B&A to ensure that a representative random sample of Ethiopian adults was collected. There are three stages to this type of sampling methodology. First, after stratifying the Ethiopian population by region and population density, sampling points (SPs) were determined. SPs were then randomly selected within each stratum. In the second stage, using the random route method, dwellings were selected within each SP. The random route method involves selecting an address in each SP at random as a starting point. Each interviewer was given instructions to identify additional dwellings by taking alternate left and right turns and stopping at every Nth dwelling. The third and final stage involved selecting actual participants - for each selected dwelling, individual respondents were chosen using a Kish grid. In a Kish grid, prior to beginning the interview, the interviewer first asks for the ages and genders of every household member (only persons aged 18 or older were eligible for selection).

The pilot phase has now concluded and the HSNP is beginning to scale up under Phase 2. The ASALs are extremely food-insecure areas highly prone to drought, which have experienced recurrent food crises and food aid responses for decades. The HSNP is intended to reduce dependency on emergency food aid by sustainably strengthening livelihoods through cash transfers. 

Oxford Policy Management was responsible for the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the programme under the pilot phase, with the intention of informing programme scale-up as well as the government’s social protection strategy more generally. The M&E involved a large-scale rigorous community-randomised controlled impact evaluation household survey, assessment of targeting performance of three alternative targeting mechanisms (Social Pension; Dependency Ratio; Community-based Targeting), qualitative research (interviews and focus group discussions) to assess targeting and impact issues less easily captured in the quantitative survey, and on-going operational and payments monitoring to ensure the smooth implementation of the programme. Findings were communicated to the HSNP Secretariat, Government of Kenya and the Department for International Development (DFID) on a regular basis to inform and advise on policy revisions and development. The M&E component used the data it produced to advise the design of HSNP Phase 2, including micro-simulations of different programme targeting scenarios and review of the phase 2 targeting approach which combines proxy means testing with community-based targeting.

The impact evaluation study compares the situation of HSNP and control households at the time of their selection into the programme (baseline), with their situation 12 months (year 1 follow-up) and 24 months later (year 2 follow-up). Over this 24-month period most of the HSNP households covered by the evaluation had received 11 or 12 bi-monthly transfers (initially KES 2,150, increased to KES 3,500 by the end of the evaluation period).

The evaluation sub-locations were selected from a sample frame of all secure sub-locations in each district. In each district 12 sub-locations were selected with PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) with implicit stratification by population density such that there is an even number of selected sub-locations per new district.

The evaluation sub-locations were sorted within districts by population density and paired up, with one of the pair being control and one being treatment. 
The sampling strategy for the quantitative survey was designed in order to enable a comparison of the relative targeting performance of three different targeting mechanisms. These are: 

- Community-based targeting (CBT): The community collectively selected households they consider most in need of transfers, up to a quota of 50% of all households in the community;
- Dependency ratio targeting (DR): Households were selected if individuals under 18 years old, over 55 years old, disabled or chronically ill made up more than a specified proportion of all household members; 
- Social pension (SP): All individuals aged 55 or older were selected. 

For both the treatment and control sub-locations there are an equal number of CBT, SP and DR sub-locations. Assignment of targeting mechanisms to sub-locations was done randomly across the same pairs that were defined to assign treatment and control status.
In all the evaluation sub-locations, the HSNP Admin component implemented the targeting process. In half the sub-locations the selected recipients started receiving the transfer as soon as they were enrolled on the programme - these are referred to as the treatment sub-locations. In the other half of the evaluation sub-locations, the selected recipients were not to receive the transfer for the first two years after enrolment - these are referred to as the control sub-locations. 

The households in the treatment sub-locations that are selected for the programme are referred to as the treatment group. These households are beneficiaries of the programme. In control sub-locations the households that are selected for the programme are referred to as the control group. These households are also beneficiaries of the programme but only begin to receive payments two years after registration. The targeting process was identical in the treatment and control sub-locations.
The following population groups can thus be identified and sampled: 
- Group A: Households in the treatment sub-locations selected for inclusion in the programme;
- Group B: Households in control sub-locations selected for inclusion in the programme but with delayed payments;
- Group C: Households in treatment sub-locations that were not selected for inclusion in the programme; 
- Group D: Households in control sub-locations that were not selected for inclusion in the programme.

Because targeting was conducted in both treatment and control areas, households were sampled in the same way across treatment and control areas. Selected households (groups A and B) were sampled from HSNP administrative records. Sixty six beneficiary households were sampled using simple random sampling (SRS) in each sub-location (in two of sub-locations this was not possible due to insufficient numbers of beneficiaries in the programme records). In cases of household non-response replacements were randomly drawn from the remaining list of non-sampled households. This process was strictly controlled by the District Team Leaders.

Non-selected households (groups C and D) were sampled from household listings undertaken in a sample of three settlements within each sub-location. These settlements were randomly sampled. The settlement sample was stratified by settlement type, with one settlement of each type being sampled. Settlements were stratified into three different types: 
1. Main settlement (the main settlement was defined as the main permanent settlement in the sub-location, often known as the sub-location centre and usually where the sub-location chief was based. As there was always one main settlement by definition, the main settlement was thereby always selected with certainty).
2. Permanent settlements (permanent settlement is defined as a collection of dwellings where at least some households are always resident, and/or there is at least one permanent structure).
3. Non-permanent settlements.

As concern community level data, community questionnaires were conducted in every community for which at least one household interview was attached. A community was defined as a settlement or a sub-section of a settlement if that settlement had been segmented due to its size. Due to missing data, a small proportion of households are not linked to any community data.

For more details please refer to this report in Related Materials section.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],NA,"Two versions of the sampling weight are provided:

1) hh_wt sampling weights produce estimates for all households living in sub-locations covered by the evaluation (i.e. the study population). They do not provide estimates for any larger population.
Weights are given by the inverse probability of being selected by strata. For selected households, the weights are given by: wi = Ni /ni, where:
- ni is the number of beneficiary households interviewed in the ith sub-location;
- Ni is the number of beneficiaries listed in the HSNP administrative data for that sub-location.

For non-selected households, the weights are given by:wijk = 1 / [ (aijk/Aijk) *(1/bij)*(1/cij) ], where where:
- Aijk is the total number of non-beneficiary households of residency status k in the selected segment of the selected type j settlement in sub-location i;
- aijk is the number of households of residency status k in the selected segment of the selected type j settlement in sub-location i that were interviewed;
- bij is the total number of segments in the selected type j settlement in sub-location i (often bij=1);
- cij is the total number of settlements of type j in sub-location i.

2) hh_wt_original sampling weights produce representative statistics for the entire population of secure sub-locations within each district. 

Community-level variables can be weighted using community weights (cmq_wt), which equal the sum of household weights across the households lnked to that community.

The data files described in this documentation correspond to a household sample survey carried out in three rounds (baseline in 2012, follow up 1 in 2013 and follow up 2 in 2014) with the objective of evaluating the impact of the Uganda Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE) programme in 14 pilot districts across the Eastern, Central, Western and Northen districts in Uganda. 

The impact evaluation has the following objectives:
- Assess the impact and operational effectiveness of the SAGE pilot programme.
- Compare the relative performance of the two targeting methodologies used in the pilot.

The evaluation assesses SAGE against its main objectives of empowering recipient households through:
- Reducing material deprivation
- Increasing economic security
- Reducing social exclusion
- Increasing access to services.

<b> What is the SAGE Programme?</b> 

The SAGE programme transfer is currently worth UGX 25,000 per month and is paid every two months. This transfer is provided using electronic transfers. The two targeting methodologies being implemented are as follows:
- Vulnerable Family Support Grant (VFSG) - This employs a composite index based on demographic indicators of vulnerability to determine eligbility.
- Senior Citizen Grant (SCG) - This uses age to determine eligibility. 

Under the VFSG, if they are present in a beneficiary household, adult women are selected by the programme to be the physical recipient of transfers. In the case of SCG, the transfer is given to the specific older person enrolled.",irst Follow-up data collection-2013-09-2013-1,"The basic unit of analysis is at the household level.

In order to deliver the quantitative impact evaluation study design, a three-round longitudinal household panel survey was conducted. The quantitative survey was implemented in 398 clusters across 48 sub-counties in eight programme districts. The evaluation was conducted in eight of the 14 districts, in agreement with the programme. This was in order to minimise the operational burden of the evaluation on the programme, due to the requirement that the evaluation randomly assign targeting mechanisms between sub-counties within evaluation districts. Consequently, it was agreed to exclude from the evaluation the six 'new' districts that were created from the original districts when theadministrative boundaries were redrawn in 2010.

<b> Selection of Sub-counties </b> 
Evaluation sub-counties were randomly selected from a list of sub-counties provided by the Uganda 2002 census. This list had to be adjusted to incorporate the 2010 sub-county boundary changes, with the populations of the new sub-counties provided by SAGE. The sample frame was thus comprised of the 74 sub-counties (as defined by the old administrative boundaries) in the eight programme evaluation districts, minus six that were excluded from selection for the evaluation.

Prior to selection, this list of 68 sub-counties was first randomly divided into two lists, one from which SCGsub-counties were drawn and one from which VFSG sub-counties were drawn. This random allocation of treatment was done to ensure a similar spread of sub-counties in both SCG and VFSG lists, allowing for rigorous comparison across the two targeting methodologies. The 24 SCG and 24 VFSG sub-counties to be covered by the evaluation were then randomly selected from the SCG and VFSG sub-county lists respectively. Sub-counties were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS).

The sampling of evaluation sub-counties had to account for the fact that in Karamoja only the SCG targeting mechanism was to be applied. To avoid sub-counties in the Karamoja region being over-represented in the SCG sub-county list, the list of VFSG sub-counties was not restricted to exclude those in the Karamoja region. Instead those Karamoja sub-counties that were randomly allocated to the VFSG sub-county list were then excluded, with the 24 VFSG evaluation sub-counties randomly selected from the restricted sub-county list.

<b> Selection of Evaluation Primary Sampling Units </b> 
Within selected evaluation sub-counties a number of primary sampling units (PSUs) or clusters were drawn. The precise number of clusters depended on balancing a number of different factors: whether the unit was practically viable for use as a cluster for survey implementation; the population density of treatment and comparison households per cluster at the specified bandwidth; the number of clusters required at the specified bandwidth in order to achieve the proposed household sample size; and the number of clusters that it was financially viable to survey.

400 clusters (200 SCG; 200 VFSG) were randomly selected from across the 48 evaluation sub-counties, where the unit of cluster was the village, and using PPS based on the number of households within the bandwidth in each PSU. Due to the use of PPS and the relatively large size of a few villages compared to all the other villages, one SCG community was selected twice. Furthermore, during fieldwork it was found that two SCG communities in the sample frame that had been selected were in fact one community. This means that the final number of SCG communities is 198 and not 200, meaning that the final cluster sample comprised 398 discrete villages.

<b> Sampling of Evaluation Households </b> 
From each of the 398 sampled villages, five treatment and five comparison group households were randomly selected for interview; with the exception of the two clusters that were sampled twice, from which 10 treatment and 10 comparison households were selected. In cases where insufficient treatment or comparison households were present within a particular village, the sample was re-distributed according to the following protocol:
- For low density villages that contain between six and nine evaluation households (i.e. treatment or comparison households within the evaluation bandwidth), replacements were taken from other sampled villages within the same sub-county. This was done by randomly selecting replacement households from the full list of households living in sampled evaluation villages in the same sub-county, that had not already been sampled. 
- In order to minimise the negative effect of the redistribution of sampled households between clusters on the logistics of the fieldwork, we restricted the total number of households to be interviewed within a particular village to a maximum of 12 households.
- Extremely low density villages containing less than six households within the bandwidth in total (either treatment or comparison) were dropped from the sample frame. Analysis of the most recent available SAGE MIS data from the six pre-pilot sub-counties shows that this represents only a very small proportionof beneficiaries and villages.

<b> Selection of Control Communities </b> 
A sample of 100 control communities was also surveyed in order to measure impact on a selection of community-level outcomes. The control communities survey did not include a household survey. The control communities were identified using matching techniques, which match treatment and control communities using characteristics drawn from the 2002 Uganda Census. The control communities are located across six control districts, chosen using the same rationale as was used to select the 14 pilot programme districts, to obtain maximum comparability. The six control districts selected were: Nakasongola in the Central region; Kamuli and Buyende in the Eastern region; Pader and Agago in the Northern region; and Kamwenge in the Western region.",Face-to-face [f2f],"In each round there was a household questionnaire which was administered to each household and collected the household and individual level information. This contained modules on household characteristics, education, health, activities of the household members, migration, housing conditions, empowerment, assets, land and livestock,  subjective poverty, saving and borrowing, formal/informal transfers, hunger scale, consumption, operational and targeting, anthropometry. In addition a community questionnaire was conducted in each community.  This includes modules on communities access to facilities, wages, local goods and prices.","Weights were given by the inverse of the probability of being selected. The household's probability of selection was broken down into two component parts: 
1) the probability of selection of the PSU; and
2) the probability of being selected into treatment and comparison groups from the list of all possible SAGE eligible and non-eligible households within the specified bandwidths in that PSU. 

In the calculation of the survey weights we ignored the probability associated with the selection of the evaluation sub-counties. Doing so reduces the variance of the final weights, thereby reducing the variance of point estimates and increasing the likelihood of detecting impact should the SAGE programme impact key outcome indicators. Furthermore, 48 out of a total 68 sub-counties have been included in the evaluation, meaning that the evaluation sample of sub-counties is already very representative of the total pilot population of sub-counties.

We defined the two component probabilities as follows:

<b> P1 </b>: Probability of a PSU being selected. PSUs were randomly selected using the PPS techniques separately for SCG and VFSG areas, drawn from a sample frame of all PSUs within evaluation sub-counties.
<b> P1 </b> = Number of households in bandwidth in PSU/total number of households in badwidth in evaluation sub-counties

<b> P2 </b>: Probability of being selected from the full list of treatment or comparison group households within a PSU (depending on whether household was a treatment or comparison household)
<b> P2 </b> = Number of sampled treatment or control households in PSU/total number of treatment or control households in PSU

The final probability of a household being selected for the SAGE baseline survey was calculated by combing <b> P1 </b>  & <b> P2 </b>, as follows:
Probability of selection = <b> P1 x P2 </b>.

Thus, the final analytical weights applied to each household were constructed by taking the inverse of the probability of selection.","Merttens, Oxford Policy Management.

The sample consisted of four strata based on four regions: Tigray Afar (Eritrean refugees), Gambella (South Sudanese refugees), Benishangul Gumuz (Sudanese refugees), and Somali (Somali refugees). Each region hosts predominantly one refugee nationality leading to an implicit stratification based on nationality. In each stratum, camps were divided into Enumeration Areas (EAs) of equal size using GIS technology, and 82 EAs were selected per stratum. Within the stratum, the number of EAs per camp was selected proportional to the size of the camp. Within camps, EAs were selected with equal probability. Within each selected EA, all households were listed and then 12 were randomly selected for interview.

The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. For refugees, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum, multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households, and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA (usually 12) divided by the total number of households listed in the EA. Sampling weights for refugees were scaled to equal the number of households per strata as per the sampling frame provided by UNHCR. Due to changes in the sample during fieldwork, the number of EAs surveyed in each stratum differed from the original sample. The weights were also scaled to correct for this change.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include: - the Identification of the Primary Investigator - the title of the survey (including country, acronym and year of implementation) - the survey reference number - the source and date of download.","The user of the data acknowledges that the original collector of the data, the authorized distributor of the data, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.",https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3445,39;13;60,"refugee, programme, country, migration, migrant, labour, remittance, population, international, asylum;household, poverty, poor, income, rural, high, inequality, access, low, population;community, village, district, project, group, local, people, activity, woman, area",39.60924823357933,8.614180691725513,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
