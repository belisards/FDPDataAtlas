The UDHS is the fourth com­prehensive survey conducted in Uganda as part of the worldwide Demographic and Health Sur­veys (DHS) project. The primary purpose of the UDHS is to furnish policymakers and planners with detailed information on fertility; family planning; infant, child, adult, and maternal mor­tality; maternal and child health; nutrition; and knowledge of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. In addition, in one in three households selected for the survey, women age 15-49, men age 15-54, and children under age 5 years were weighed and their height was measured. Women, men, and children age 6-59 months in this subset of households were tested for anaemia, and women and children were tested for vitamin A deficiency. The 2006 UDHS is the first DHS survey in Uganda to cover the entire country. 

The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) was designed to provide information on demographic, health, and family planning status and trends in the country. Specifically, the UDHS collected information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, and breastfeeding practices. In addition, data were collected on the nutritional status of mothers and young children; infant, child, adult, and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and levels of anaemia and vitamin A deficiency.  

The 2006 UDHS is a follow-up to the 1988-1989, 1995, and 2000-2001 UDHS surveys, which were also implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The specific objectives of the 2006 UDHS are as follows: 

- To collect data at the national level that will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly the fertility and infant mortality rates 
- To analyse the direct and indirect factors that determine the level and trends in fertility and mortality 
- To measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice of women and men by method, by urban-rural residence, and by region 
- To collect data on knowledge and attitudes of women and men about sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, and to evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use 
- To assess the nutritional status of children under age five and women by means of anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and to assess child feeding practices 
- To collect data on family health, including immunizations, prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea and other diseases among children under five, antenatal visits, assistance at delivery, and breastfeeding 
- To measure vitamin A deficiency in women and children, and to measure anaemia in women, men, and children 
- To measure key education indicators including school attendance ratios and primary school grade repetition and dropout rates 
- To collect information on the extent of disability 
- To collect information on the extent of gender-based violence. 

MAIN RESULTS

- Fertility : Survey results indicate that the total fertility rate (TFR) for the country is 6.7 births per woman. The TFR in urban areas is much lower than in the rural areas (4.4 and 7.1 children, re­spectively). Kampala, whose TFR is 3.7, has the lowest fertility. Fertility rates in Central 1, Central 2, and Southwest regions are also lower than the national level. Removing four districts from the 2006 data that were not covered in the 2000­2001 UDHS, the 2006 TFR is 6.5 births per woman, compared with 6.9 from the 2000-2001 UDHS. Education and wealth have a marked effect on fertility, with uneducated mothers hav­ing about three more children on average than women with at least some secondary education and women in the lowest wealth quintile having almost twice as many children as women in the highest wealth quintile. 

- Family planning : Overall, knowledge of family planning has remained consistently high in Uganda over the past five years, with 97 percent of all women and 98 percent of all men age 15-49 having heard of at least one method of contraception. Pills, injectables, and condoms are the most widely known modern methods among both women and men. 

- Maternal health : Ninety-four percent of women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a skilled health pro­fessional for their last birth. These results are comparable to the 2000-2001 UDHS. Only 47 percent of women make four or more antenatal care visits during their entire pregnancy, an im­provement from 42 percent in the 2000-2001 UDHS. The median duration of pregnancy for the first antenatal visit is 5.5 months, indicating that Ugandan women start antenatal care at a relatively late stage in pregnancy.  

- Child health : Forty-six percent of children age 12-23 months have been fully vaccinated. Over nine in ten (91 percent) have received the BCG vaccina­tion, and 68 percent have been vaccinated against measles. The coverage for the first doses of DPT and polio is relatively high (90 percent for each). However, only 64 percent go on to receive the third dose of DPT, and only 59 per­cent receive their third dose of polio vaccine. There are notable improvements in vaccination coverage since the 2000-2001 UDHS. The per­centage of children age 12-23 months fully vac­cinated at the time of the survey increased from 37 percent in 2000-2001 to 44 percent in 2006. The percentage who had received none of the six basic vaccinations decreased from 13 percent in 2000-2001 to 8 percent in 2006. 

- Malaria : The 2006 UDHS gathered information on the use of mosquito nets, both treated and un­treated. The data show that only 34 percent of households in Uganda own a mosquito net, with 16 percent of households owning an insecticide-treated net (ITN). Only 22 percent of children under five slept under a mosquito net on the night before the interview, while a mere 10 per­cent slept under an ITN.

- Breastfeeding and nutrition : In Uganda, almost all children are breastfed at some point. However, only six in ten children under the age of 6 months are exclusively breast-fed. 

- HIV/AIDS AND stis : Knowledge of AIDS is very high and wide­spread in Uganda. In terms of HIV prevention strategies, women and men are most aware that the chances of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced by limiting sex to one uninfected partner who has no other partners (89 percent of women and 95 percent of men) or by abstaining from sexual intercourse (86 percent of women and 93 percent of men). Knowledge of condoms and the role they can play in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus is not quite as high (70 percent of women and 84 percent of men). 

- Orphanhood and vulnerability : Almost one in seven children under age 18 is orphaned (15 percent), that is, one or both par­ents are dead. Only 3 percent of children under the age of 18 have lost both biological parents. 

- Women's status and gender violence : Data for the 2006 UDHS show that women in Uganda are generally less educated than men. Although the gender gap has narrowed in recent years, 19 percent of women age 15-49 have never been to school, compared with only 5 per­cent of men in the same age group.

- Mortality : At current mortality levels, one in every 13 Ugandan children dies before reaching age one, while one in every seven does not survive to the fifth birthday. After removing districts not cov­ered in the 2000-2001 UDHS from the 2006 data, findings show that infant mortality has de­clined from 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in the 2000-2001 UDHS to 75 in the 2006 UDHS. Un­der-five mortality has declined from 158 deaths per 1,000 live births to 137.",2006-04-2006-1,"- Household

A representative probability sample of 9,864 households was selected for the 2006 UDHS survey. The sample was selected in two stages. In the first stage, 321 clusters were selected from among a list of clusters sampled in the 2005-2006 Uganda National Household Survey (UBOS, 2006c). This matching of samples was conducted in order to allow for linking of 2006 UDHS health indicators to poverty data from the 2005-2006 UNHS. The clusters from the Uganda National Household Survey were in turn selected from the 2002 Census sample frame. For the UDHS 2006, an additional 17 clusters were selected from the 2002 Census frame in Karamoja in order to increase the sample size to allow for reporting of Karamoja­specific estimates in the UDHS. Finally, 30 IDP camps were selected from a list of camps compiled by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (UN OCHA) as of July 2005, completing a total of 368 primary sampling units. Figure 1.1 shows the geographical distribution of the 368 clusters visited in the 2006 UDHS. 

In the second stage, households in each cluster were selected based on a complete listing of households. In the 321 clusters that were included in the UNHS sample, the lists of households used were those generated during the UNHS listing operations April-August 2005. The UNHS sampled ten households per cluster. All ten were purposively included in the UDHS sample. An additional 15 to 20 households were randomly selected in each cluster. The 17 additional clusters in Karamoja were listed, and 27 households were selected in each cluster. The selected IDP camps were divided into segments because of their large size, and one segment selected in each camp. Then a listing operation was carried out in the selected segment, and 30 households were selected in each camp from the segment of the map that was listed. All women age 15-49 who were either permanent residents of the households in the 2006 UDHS sample or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed. In addition, in a sub-sample of one-third of all the households selected for the survey, all men age 15-54 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey. Indicators such as total fertility rate, childhood mortality rates, and the maternal mortality ratio require a larger sample size than other indicators. These indicators are all calculated from the data provided by female respondents only. For this reason, the number of male respondents required in the sample to obtain acceptable precision in estimates of desired indicators is lower than the number of female respondents. 

Biomarkers collected in the UDHS included height and weight measurements for children under 6 years, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; anaemia testing in children age 6 to 59 months old, women age 15-49, and men age 15-54; and dried blood spot collection for vitamin A testing in children age 6 to 59 months old and women age 15 to 49 years. All of these biomarkers were measured only in those households selected for the male interview-that is, one in three households. 

COMPARABILITY OF THE 2006 UDHS SAMPLE WITH SAMPLES FROM PREVIOUS UDHS SURVEYS 

The 2006 UDHS is the first UDHS to include the entire country in the sample. In previous surveys, it was necessary to exclude groups of districts because of security problems. In the 2000-2001 UDHS, areas making up the current districts of Amuru, Bundibugyo, Gulu, Kasese, Kitgum, and Pader were excluded from the sample. According to the 2002 Census, these areas comprise around 7 percent of the population of Uganda (UBOS 2006a). The 1995 UDHS excluded Kitgum and Pader, while the 1988­1989 UDHS excluded most of the Northern region. 

To show trends using comparable data, the 2006 UDHS data were run without the districts that were excluded in previous surveys. For some key indicators, the report presents two estimates from the 2006 data: one covering the entire country, and a second covering the geographic area surveyed in the 2000-2001 UDHS. Differences between these two estimates are small, seldom exceeding one or two percentage points. 

Because it was not possible to run every indicator twice, the report includes many comparisons between the 2000-2001 and 2006 surveys in which the 2006 data have not been adjusted. The report states explicitly when the 2006 data presented are adjusted; otherwise, the data are unadjusted. Comparisons that include unadjusted 2006 data should be interpreted with caution.",Face-to-face,"Three questionnaires were used for the 2006 UDHS, namely, the Household Questionnaire, the Women's Questionnaire, and the Men's Questionnaire. The contents of these questionnaires were based on the model questionnaires for the MEASURE DHS program. In consultation with technical institutions and local organizations, UBOS adapted these questionnaires to reflect population and health issues relevant in Uganda. The revized questionnaires were translated from English into six local languages, namely, Ateso/Karamojong, Luganda, Lugbara, Luo, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The questionnaires were pretested prior to their finalization in January and February of 2006. 

a) The Household Questionnaire was used to list all the usual members and visitors in the selected households. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. Some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. For children under age 18, survival status of the parents was determined. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, ownership of various durable goods, and ownership and use of mosquito nets. Care and support services received by orphans and other vulnerable children and disability status of household members were also collected in the Household Questionnaires. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was used to document the respondents' decision as to whether to volunteer to give blood samples for vitamin A deficiency (VAD) testing as well as to record the height, weight, and haemoglobin measurements of women age 15-49 years, men age 15-54 years, and children age 6-59 months in those households selected for these measurements.  

b) The Women's Questionnaire was used to collect information from all women age 15-49. These women were asked questions on the following topics: 
- Background characteristics (education, residential history, media exposure, etc.) 
- Birth history and childhood mortality 
- Knowledge and use of family planning methods 
- Fertility preferences 
- Antenatal and childbirth care 
- Breastfeeding and infant feeding practices 
- Vaccinations and childhood illnesses 
- Marriage and sexual activity 
- Woman's work and husband's background characteristics 
- Awareness and behavior regarding AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
- Maternal mortality 
- Domestic violence.  

c) The Men's Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-54  living in every third household in the 2006 UDHS sample. The Men's Questionnaire collected much of the same information found in the Women's Questionnaire, but was shorter because it did not contain a detailed reproductive history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition, or maternal mortality.",NA,"Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

        The UNHCR Livelihoods Monitoring Framework takes a program-based approach to monitoring, with the aim of tracking both outputs and the impact of UNHCR dollars spent on programming (either via partners or through direct implementation).

The process for developing the indicators began in 2015 with a review of existing tools and approaches. Consultations were held with governments, the private sector, field-based staff and civil society partners to devise a set of common, standardized measures rooted in global good practices.

Since 2017, a data collection (survey) has been rolled out globally, and the participating operations conducted a household surveys to a sample of beneficiaries of each livelihoods project implemented by UNHCR and its partner. The dataset consists of baseline and endline data from the same sample beneficiaries, in order to compare before and after the project implementation and thus to measure the impact.

The 2002 population and housing census provided a frame for sample selection. The frame contains a list of all administrative units up to the lowest level called, 'Local Council 1', or LC1. This is usually, but not always consistent with a village in terms of area. The Enumeration Area (EA) may comprise of one village/LC1, or more than one village/LC1. The demarcation of EAs is based on total population within a given area and in many instances, may vary by locality. In addition the sampling frame also indicates the EA to which a particular LC belongs. The 2002 Uganda Sampling Frame has a total of 33,283 EAs. 

Study population

The study population comprised of the entire population of Uganda. Based on the distribution of households in table 1 above, the sample was determined based on information from Uganda National Household survey 2005/06 conducted by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics.  The proportion of internal migrants reported in the past 5 years has been used to estimate the required sample. Given the limited nature of the number of international migrants, the proportion of internal migrants is considered adequate to provide sufficient estimates of the indicators of interest.

Sample allocation by region

The above sample was proportionately allocated across the four statistical regions on the basis of the population in each of the regions. There was oversampling for urban population approximately by 5 times. To ease implementation, the regional sample was further disaggregated down to Enumeration Area level. 

Selection of Enumeration Areas

The task was to undertake a nationally-representative survey of 2,000 households (urban and rural combined) in 2009 that would provide information on migration, remittances and their effects on development.
The frame was be divided into two strata namely rural and urban. A two-stage stratified sample design was adopted. The first stage representing the primary sampling unit comprised of the selection of EAs from each of the strata while at the second and ultimate stage households were selected. EAs were selected from the list of Enumeration Areas developed after the 2002 Population and Housing Census and updated to include new districts. 

The selection of EAs was proportionally done based on the number of households in the respective stratum according to the 2006 Uganda household survey. All the EAs in each domain were sorted by county, sub-county and parish. A random number was generated and an appropriate random start and sampling interval was systematically selected from the ordered list with probability proportionate to number of households.  This was done separately for urban and rural areas, hence stratified sampling.  The proportion of EAs sampled in urban areas is about 5 times that in rural.

Selection of households

At the second stage, a complete listing of households in each EA was done to classify the households into three groups: non migrants, internal migrants and international migrants. The number of households per EA varied from around 20 to about 1000. Most of the time, all households were listed even in the large EAs since it was difficult to establish lines of demarcation to segment the EA. 

A total of 10 households were selected randomly from each of the 200 EAs. The goal was to select 4 households with an international migrant (emigrant), 3 with one or more internal migrants, and 3 with no migrant. This sampling was done from the three strata or listings of households according to migration status. Separate sampling was done from each stratum using systematic sampling.  In case of a refusal or other reason for non-response, another household was selected from the same stratum to reach the desired quota.   In case the number of households listed in any of the three strata was smaller than the numbers desired (4, 3, 3), then all those listed in that stratum were automatically sampled and the short fall selected from the next stratum. 

For example, if there were, say, 150 households in an EA, with 3 with international migrants, 27 with internal migrants, and 120 with no migrants, the numbers selected would be, respectively, 3, 3 and 3.  But to make up 10, priority would be given to the migrant stratum to add one more, randomly selected, from that stratum.  As another example, suppose there were 0 international migrant households; then 7 would be selected from the internal migrant stratum and still only 3 from the list of non-migrant households.

The choice of 10 households per EA was based on experience from the various economic surveys conducted by UBOS, where 10 households provide adequate representation at EA level for most of the economic and social indicators. 

The listing operation

The survey targeted household with in-migrants or former members who have migrated away, whether to another part of the country (urban or rural) or to another country. Since the census frame does not uniquely identify who is a migrant or non migrant, and owing to the lack of an up to date list of all households in Uganda from which to draw the sample, the survey team adopted a listing exercise as stop gap measure. 

The exercise involved conducting a fresh listing of all households in each of the selected EAs. During the exercise, households with migrants were identified and the migrants clearly categorized as internal-within Uganda- or international where household members had moved to another country all together. The total number of listed household numbers was 24,618. Thereafter, a sample of 10 households was selected using systematic sampling procedure.",Face-to-face [f2f],"The questionnaire consisted of seven sections namely:
A Cover Sheet requiring  household identification particulars including district name and code, county name and code, parish name and code, EA name, stratum, household number, names of the household head and first spouse, number of household members and a description of the location of the household.

In addition, the page captured details of the interview including the interviewer name, date, duration and the outcome of the interview. It also provided for the team leaders remarks and signature.

Section 1: Household roster
This section captured the socio-demographic characteristics of all household members.

Section 2: Households housing conditions
In this section, information was sought on the type of dwelling, occupancy status, the physical characteristics of the dwelling, and access to basic utilities including water, electricity and sanitation.  

Section 3 Household Assets and Expenditure
The section collected information on the assets and expenditures of the household. This information was used to determine the welfare status of the household.

Section 4: Household Use of Financial Services:
In this section, information relating to use of financial services by household members was collected. 

Section 5: Internal and International Migration And Remittances From Former Household Members
This section captured information on migration, both internal and international as well as remittances received by the household from former household member migrants.

Section 6: Internal and International Migration and Remittances From Former Household Members
Like section 5 above, section 6 sought information on migration, both internal and international as well as remittances received by the household from non household member migrants.

Section 7: Return Migrants
Here information on Return migrants was captured. A return migrant was defined as an adult member (over 18 years old) currently living in the household, who had lived in another country or another place in Uganda for at least 3 months in the 5 years preceding the survey.  The information sought in this section related to the last migration episode for each return migrant.","The first stage comprised of total number of households in the listed EAs and the total number of households in the entire frame. The total number of households was used as the measure of size. 

At the second stage, the total number of households listed was used to select the sample of 10 as described above. This fraction constituted the second stage weights.

The product of these two weights, with the appropriate sampling fraction, yielded the final EA/household weights used. (Note that the reciprocal of the weight).","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

To construct the sampling weights, we follow the steps outlined in Himelein, K. (2014), though we do not have information for all of the steps:

Begin with base weights. Base weights will equal 1 for all intents and purposes.
2. Derive attrition-adjusted weights for all individuals by running a logistic response propensity model based on characteristics of the household head (i.e. education, labor force status, demographic characteristics), characteristics of the household (consumption, assets, financial characteristics), and characteristics of the dwelling (house ownership, overcrowding). While the proGRES database is limited in the number of socio-economic variables, we have characteristics of the household head and household.
3. Trim weights by replacing the top two percent of observations with the 98th percentile cut-off point; and
4. Post-stratify weights to known population totals to correct for the imbalances across the sample. In doing so, we ensure that the distribution in the survey matches the distribution in the proGRES database.

Against the background of ever-limited resources and recognizing that the refugee population is not homogeneously vulnerable, in mid-2021 WFP and UNHCR initiated the shift to the targeted provision of food assistance based on needs.
  A targeting strategy – developed by UNHCR and WFP with support from the Joint UNHCR-WFP Programme Excellence and Targeting Hub - was formulated with the following objectives:
- Identify vulnerable refugee households in need of humanitarian assistance and less vulnerable refugees with higher livelihood resilience who would benefit from livelihoods support;
- Ensure the greatest protection outcomes through strong community participation, communications with refugee communities and risk analysis to inform the approach.
  This second JPDM has served to ensure that the corporate practice of post-distribution monitoring is fulfilled. Additionally, it assessed the extent to which the targeting approach has – over a period of five months between May and September 2021 – achieved the above objectives.

  In addition, to better understand the vulnerability status of households receiving various assistance since the targeting started, the sampling of the 2nd JPDM was also designed to be representative at the assistance group level. Same as the first JPDM, the assessment team used the total number of ProGres Groups by the time the survey was designed (August 2021) as the most reliable proxy to the total number of households, hence the sample frame. The sample size was planned to reach (a minimum of) 2,400 households in total with 95% confidence level and 5% margin error while factoring a 15% non-response rate. The distribution of the households by camp and by eligibility group was proportional to the distribution of number of the total population in each stratification.
  a household panel study
A panel component was incorporated in the 2nd JPDM. By sampling the households who were surveyed in the December’s 2020 JPDM and comparing their performances in key outcome indicators through a longitudinal analysis over a period of 5 months (May 2021 – September 2021). The assessment sheds light on the effectiveness of the targeting as other factors that may confound the interpretation of targeting impact such as refugees mobility, are controlled. 
  Among the sampled households of December 2020, those who remain registered/trackable in the camp and at the same time, have held the same eligibility group status since targeting started were sampled for the survey. In other words, among the total sample, the panel households were interviewed and the additional number of households needed to reach the overall sample plan was added from random sampling from ProGres",Face-to-face [f2f],NA,Weights have been calculated as the total households per group per location/selected households per target group per location,"UNHCR, WFP (2021).

UNHCR and WVI carried out a nutrition survey in Makpandu from 7 to 10 October 2019. Makpandu refugee settlement has an estimated refugee population of 50382 who are mainly from DRC and CAR, and a few from Sudan and Eritrea. 

The overall aim of this survey was to assess the general nutrition and health status of refugee population and formulate workable recommendations for appropriate nutritional and public health interventions. The survey was based on the UNHCR Standardized Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) guidelines for refugee populations (version 2, 2013) http://sens.unhcr.org/. 
Four SENS modules including i. anthropometric and health, ii. Anaemia, iii. IYCF, and iv. Food Security were carried out. 
2019 was the first-time modules ii, iii and iv were carried out thus the data from these modules will be used as the baseline.

A total of six survey teams composed of four members each (one team leader, one haemoglobin measurer, one anthropometric measurer/translator and one anthropometric/haemoglobin measurement assistant) were included in each survey. A standardised training lasting four days was provided followed which included a standardisation test. Data collection lasted four days.

The survey teams were supported by a team of 2 supervisors and 2 coordinators who roved between the teams during the data collection. Mobile phone questionnaires using Open Data Kit (ODK) android software for all the modules was used for data collection. Data validation was carried out on a daily by the survey coordinator which allowed for daily feedback to the survey teams",2019-10-07-2019-10-1,"Children 0-23 months

A random household sample was drawn from the actual number of physically verified household before the survey

All the eligible household members were included in the survey; that is all children 6 to 59 months / (0-23 months for IYCF) and women 15 to 49 years in a sampled household. The interview was conducted in most cases with the mother in the household or in her absence with an adult member of the household who was knowledgeable with the everyday running of the household. The survey defined a household as the number of people who regularly stay together and eat from the same pot. 266 of the listed households of the 529 listed were surveyed. Each team was allocated a number of households. Block locations and boundaries was discussed during the training to ensure all teams knew where to go.

If a child was absent, the teams were instructed to revisit the household one more time. If they were unsuccessful after this, the child was recorded as absent and they were not replaced with another child. If the household refused to participate then it was considered a refusal and the household was not replaced with another. If a selected child was living with a disability or a physical deformity preventing certain anthropometric measurements the child was still included in the assessment of the other indicators.

UNHCR in collaboration with its partners, coordinated a SENS survey in Maban County between November 16th and December 4th in 2019.

Maban County is in Upper Nile State in the North East of the Republic of South Sudan (RoSS). The refugee caseload is composed of Sudanese fleeing from the conflict in Blue Nile State in Sudan, residing in four refugee camps; Doro, Yusuf Batil, Gendrassa and Kaya. The overall aim of the survey was to assess the nutrition situation among the refugee population and to monitor ongoing programme interventions. In each of the camps a cross- sectional survey was conducted using the UNHCR Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) version 2, 2013 guidelines http://sens.unhcr.org/ and the Standardised Monitoring and Assessments of Relief and Transitions (SMART) guidelines https://smartmethodology.org/ . Systematic random sampling was used to identify the survey respondents. 
Three population groups; children 6-59 months, infants 0-5 months and women of reproductive age 15-49 years were included in the survey. Household level indicators on food security were measured in households whether they included the target population groups or not.

This ambitious and important research is initially focused on three countries in East Africa - Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.
 
In order to glean insights into the remittance process in the three designated countries, the World Bank designed a two-phase survey process. Phase 1 involved conducting a national survey in each of the three countries. The purpose of the first phase of research was to collect a large representative sample of the adult population in each country. The national surveys provide important baseline data about international remittance flows including: an estimate of the percent of the total adult population that regularly receives remittances, the average amount of each remittance received, most common methods of receipt and top sending countries. Additionally, through the analysis of the national survey results, World Bank was able to identify areas of each country that have high concentrations of international remittance recipients. This important piece of information guided Phase 2 of the research - surveys of remittance receivers in each country. Whereas the national surveys aimed to collect general data about the remittance process, the surveys of remittance recipients allowed for the collection of more detailed data about the remittance process itself, how remittances are used, the relationship between sender and receiver, and interest in various financial products.
 
The results of this research will not only provide estimates of total annual amounts of remittances for each country, but also will tell us the percentage of the population in each country that is involved in the international remittance process. Furthermore, it will offer insights as to the degree to which Ethiopians, Kenyans and Ugandans depend on international remittances and how the money is used, saved and/or invested. Results will also measure interest in financial products that, if utilized, can significantly impact the financial well-being of the population and the overall economic stability of each country.",2010-07-2010-08; 2010-08-2010-0,"Households
Individuals",National Coverage,Sample survey data [ssd],NA,NA,"General:

The total samples were compiled utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling through respondent selection. Multi-stage random sampling ensured that a random sample of adults was collected in each country. First, after stratifying the population of each country by region and population density, sampling points (SPs) were determined. SPs were then randomly selected within each stratum. At each SP, respondents were randomly selected to participate in the survey.

Phase 1:

The first phase consisted of national surveys of the adult population of each country. The three survey samples were designed to be representative of the adult populations of these three countries. World Bank coordinated and oversaw all aspects of the sampling and interviewing process. A team of local field experts was hired in each country to conduct the actual interviews. All interviewers were professionally trained and supervised by research personnel. In this phase of the research, a total of 2011 Ugandan adults were interviewed.

Phase 2:

Once the national surveys were completed, the results were analyzed to determine the areas of concentration of the remittance recipient population, after which the second phase of the project was conducted. This phase of the project included a targeted survey of the remittance recipient population of each of the three East African countries. Sampling Points were established based on the analysis of the national survey data and the identification of areas within each country that showed the highest concentrations of remittances received from relatives abroad in proportion to the sample size of all areas surveyed. Once again, local field experts were hired in each country to conduct the interviews, training and supervision of field operations. Languages of interviews were the same as those employed in Phase 1 and, again, all interviews were conducted in person using the PAPI method. A total of 400 interviews with regular international remittance recipients were completed in each country during August and September of 2010. The margin of error for all three surveys is approximately ±5 percentage points and the 95 percent level of confidence.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Phase 1:

This survey consisted of 12 questions that were aimed at helping to identify some of the basic characteristics of the remittance recipient population in each country.

Phase 2:

The survey instrument for Phase 2 consisted of approximately 35 questions and included a number of variables aimed at obtaining greater detail about the remittance receiving process including costs, amounts received, information about the sender and the relationship between sender and receiver.

The data files described in this documentation correspond to a household sample survey carried out in three rounds (baseline in 2012, follow up 1 in 2013 and follow up 2 in 2014) with the objective of evaluating the impact of the Uganda Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE) programme in 14 pilot districts across the Eastern, Central, Western and Northen districts in Uganda. 

The impact evaluation has the following objectives:
- Assess the impact and operational effectiveness of the SAGE pilot programme.
- Compare the relative performance of the two targeting methodologies used in the pilot.

The evaluation assesses SAGE against its main objectives of empowering recipient households through:
- Reducing material deprivation
- Increasing economic security
- Reducing social exclusion
- Increasing access to services.

<b> What is the SAGE Programme?</b> 

The SAGE programme transfer is currently worth UGX 25,000 per month and is paid every two months. This transfer is provided using electronic transfers. The two targeting methodologies being implemented are as follows:
- Vulnerable Family Support Grant (VFSG) - This employs a composite index based on demographic indicators of vulnerability to determine eligbility.
- Senior Citizen Grant (SCG) - This uses age to determine eligibility. 

Under the VFSG, if they are present in a beneficiary household, adult women are selected by the programme to be the physical recipient of transfers. In the case of SCG, the transfer is given to the specific older person enrolled.",aseline Data Collection-2012-09-2012-1,"The basic unit of analysis is at the household level.

In order to deliver the quantitative impact evaluation study design, a three-round longitudinal household panel survey was conducted. The quantitative survey was implemented in 398 clusters across 48 sub-counties in eight programme districts. The evaluation was conducted in eight of the 14 districts, in agreement with the programme. This was in order to minimise the operational burden of the evaluation on the programme, due to the requirement that the evaluation randomly assign targeting mechanisms between sub-counties within evaluation districts. Consequently, it was agreed to exclude from the evaluation the six 'new' districts that were created from the original districts when theadministrative boundaries were redrawn in 2010.

<b> Selection of Sub-counties </b>
Evaluation sub-counties were randomly selected from a list of sub-counties provided by the Uganda 2002 census. This list had to be adjusted to incorporate the 2010 sub-county boundary changes, with the populations of the new sub-counties provided by SAGE. The sample frame was thus comprised of the 74 sub-counties (as defined by the old administrative boundaries) in the eight programme evaluation districts, minus six that were excluded from selection for the evaluation.

Prior to selection, this list of 68 sub-counties was first randomly divided into two lists, one from which SCGsub-counties were drawn and one from which VFSG sub-counties were drawn. This random allocation of treatment was done to ensure a similar spread of sub-counties in both SCG and VFSG lists, allowing for rigorous comparison across the two targeting methodologies. The 24 SCG and 24 VFSG sub-counties to be covered by the evaluation were then randomly selected from the SCG and VFSG sub-county lists respectively. Sub-counties were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS).

The sampling of evaluation sub-counties had to account for the fact that in Karamoja only the SCG targeting mechanism was to be applied. To avoid sub-counties in the Karamoja region being over-represented in the SCG sub-county list, the list of VFSG sub-counties was not restricted to exclude those in the Karamoja region. Instead those Karamoja sub-counties that were randomly allocated to the VFSG sub-county list were then excluded, with the 24 VFSG evaluation sub-counties randomly selected from the restricted sub-county list.

<b> Selection of Evaluation Primary Sampling Units </b>
Within selected evaluation sub-counties a number of primary sampling units (PSUs) or clusters were drawn. The precise number of clusters depended on balancing a number of different factors: whether the unit was practically viable for use as a cluster for survey implementation; the population density of treatment and comparison households per cluster at the specified bandwidth; the number of clusters required at the specified bandwidth in order to achieve the proposed household sample size; and the number of clusters that it was financially viable to survey.

400 clusters (200 SCG; 200 VFSG) were randomly selected from across the 48 evaluation sub-counties, where the unit of cluster was the village, and using PPS based on the number of households within the bandwidth in each PSU. Due to the use of PPS and the relatively large size of a few villages compared to all the other villages, one SCG community was selected twice. Furthermore, during fieldwork it was found that two SCG communities in the sample frame that had been selected were in fact one community. This means that the final number of SCG communities is 198 and not 200, meaning that the final cluster sample comprised 398 discrete villages.

<b> Sampling of Evaluation Households </b>

From each of the 398 sampled villages, five treatment and five comparison group households were randomly selected for interview; with the exception of the two clusters that were sampled twice, from which 10 treatment and 10 comparison households were selected. In cases where insufficient treatment or comparison households were present within a particular village, the sample was re-distributed according to the following protocol:
- For low density villages that contain between six and nine evaluation households (i.e. treatment or comparison households within the evaluation bandwidth), replacements were taken from other sampled villages within the same sub-county. This was done by randomly selecting replacement households from the full list of households living in sampled evaluation villages in the same sub-county, that had not already been sampled. 
- In order to minimise the negative effect of the redistribution of sampled households between clusters on the logistics of the fieldwork, we restricted the total number of households to be interviewed within a particular village to a maximum of 12 households.
- Extremely low density villages containing less than six households within the bandwidth in total (either treatment or comparison) were dropped from the sample frame. Analysis of the most recent available SAGE MIS data from the six pre-pilot sub-counties shows that this represents only a very small proportionof beneficiaries and villages.

<b> Selection of Control Communities </b>
A sample of 100 control communities was also surveyed in order to measure impact on a selection of community-level outcomes. The control communities survey did not include a household survey. The control communities were identified using matching techniques, which match treatment and control communities using characteristics drawn from the 2002 Uganda Census. The control communities are located across six control districts, chosen using the same rationale as was used to select the 14 pilot programme districts, to obtain maximum comparability. The six control districts selected were: Nakasongola in the Central region; Kamuli and Buyende in the Eastern region; Pader and Agago in the Northern region; and Kamwenge in the Western region.",Face-to-face [f2f],"In each round there was a household questionnaire which was administered to each household and collected the household and individual level information. This contained modules on household characteristics, education, health, activities of the household members, migration, housing conditions, empowerment, assets, land and livestock,  subjective poverty, saving and borrowing, formal/informal transfers, hunger scale, consumption, operational and targeting, anthropometry. In addition a community questionnaire was conducted in each community.  This includes modules on communities access to facilities, wages, local goods and prices.","Weights were given by the inverse of the probability of being selected. The household’s probability of selection was broken down into two component parts: 1) the probability of selection of the PSU; and 2) the probability of being selected into treatment and comparison groups from the list of all possible SAGE eligible and non-eligible households within the specified bandwidths in that PSU. In the calculation of the survey weights we ignored the probability associated with the selection of the evaluation sub-counties. Doing so reduces the variance of the final weights, thereby reducing the variance of point estimates and increasing the likelihood of detecting impact should the SAGE programme impact key outcome indicators. Furthermore, 48 out of a total 68 sub-counties have been included in the evaluation, meaning that the evaluation sample of sub-counties is already very representative of the total pilot population of sub-counties. We defined the two component probabilities as follows:

<b> P1 </b> : Probability of a PSU being selected. PSUs were randomly selected using the PPS techniques separately for SCG and VFSG areas, drawn from a sample frame of all PSUs within evaluation sub-counties.
<b> P1 </b> = Number of households in bandwidth in PSU/total number of households in badwidth in evaluation sub-counties

<b> P2 </b>: Probability of being selected from the full list of treatment or comparison group households within a PSU (depending on whether household was a treatment or comparison household)
<b> P2 </b>= Number of sampled treatment or control households in PSU/total number of treatment or control households in PSU

The final probability of a household being selected for the SAGE baseline survey was calculated by combing <b> P1</b> & <b>P2</b>, as follows:
Probability of selection = <b> P1 x P2 </b>.

Thus, the final analytical weights applied to each household were constructed by taking the inverse of the probability of selection.","Merttens, Oxford Policy Management.

The data files described in this documentation correspond to a household sample survey carried out in three rounds (baseline in 2012, follow up 1 in 2013 and follow up 2 in 2014) with the objective of evaluating the impact of the Uganda Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE) programme in 14 pilot districts across the Eastern, Central, Western and Northen districts in Uganda. 

The impact evaluation has the following objectives:
- Assess the impact and operational effectiveness of the SAGE pilot programme.
- Compare the relative performance of the two targeting methodologies used in the pilot.

The evaluation assesses SAGE against its main objectives of empowering recipient households through:
- Reducing material deprivation
- Increasing economic security
- Reducing social exclusion
- Increasing access to services.

<b> What is the SAGE Programme?</b> 

The SAGE programme transfer is currently worth UGX 25,000 per month and is paid every two months. This transfer is provided using electronic transfers. The two targeting methodologies being implemented are as follows:
- Vulnerable Family Support Grant (VFSG) - This employs a composite index based on demographic indicators of vulnerability to determine eligbility.
- Senior Citizen Grant (SCG) - This uses age to determine eligibility. 

Under the VFSG, if they are present in a beneficiary household, adult women are selected by the programme to be the physical recipient of transfers. In the case of SCG, the transfer is given to the specific older person enrolled.",irst Follow-up data collection-2013-09-2013-1,"The basic unit of analysis is at the household level.

In order to deliver the quantitative impact evaluation study design, a three-round longitudinal household panel survey was conducted. The quantitative survey was implemented in 398 clusters across 48 sub-counties in eight programme districts. The evaluation was conducted in eight of the 14 districts, in agreement with the programme. This was in order to minimise the operational burden of the evaluation on the programme, due to the requirement that the evaluation randomly assign targeting mechanisms between sub-counties within evaluation districts. Consequently, it was agreed to exclude from the evaluation the six 'new' districts that were created from the original districts when theadministrative boundaries were redrawn in 2010.

<b> Selection of Sub-counties </b> 
Evaluation sub-counties were randomly selected from a list of sub-counties provided by the Uganda 2002 census. This list had to be adjusted to incorporate the 2010 sub-county boundary changes, with the populations of the new sub-counties provided by SAGE. The sample frame was thus comprised of the 74 sub-counties (as defined by the old administrative boundaries) in the eight programme evaluation districts, minus six that were excluded from selection for the evaluation.

Prior to selection, this list of 68 sub-counties was first randomly divided into two lists, one from which SCGsub-counties were drawn and one from which VFSG sub-counties were drawn. This random allocation of treatment was done to ensure a similar spread of sub-counties in both SCG and VFSG lists, allowing for rigorous comparison across the two targeting methodologies. The 24 SCG and 24 VFSG sub-counties to be covered by the evaluation were then randomly selected from the SCG and VFSG sub-county lists respectively. Sub-counties were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS).

The sampling of evaluation sub-counties had to account for the fact that in Karamoja only the SCG targeting mechanism was to be applied. To avoid sub-counties in the Karamoja region being over-represented in the SCG sub-county list, the list of VFSG sub-counties was not restricted to exclude those in the Karamoja region. Instead those Karamoja sub-counties that were randomly allocated to the VFSG sub-county list were then excluded, with the 24 VFSG evaluation sub-counties randomly selected from the restricted sub-county list.

<b> Selection of Evaluation Primary Sampling Units </b> 
Within selected evaluation sub-counties a number of primary sampling units (PSUs) or clusters were drawn. The precise number of clusters depended on balancing a number of different factors: whether the unit was practically viable for use as a cluster for survey implementation; the population density of treatment and comparison households per cluster at the specified bandwidth; the number of clusters required at the specified bandwidth in order to achieve the proposed household sample size; and the number of clusters that it was financially viable to survey.

400 clusters (200 SCG; 200 VFSG) were randomly selected from across the 48 evaluation sub-counties, where the unit of cluster was the village, and using PPS based on the number of households within the bandwidth in each PSU. Due to the use of PPS and the relatively large size of a few villages compared to all the other villages, one SCG community was selected twice. Furthermore, during fieldwork it was found that two SCG communities in the sample frame that had been selected were in fact one community. This means that the final number of SCG communities is 198 and not 200, meaning that the final cluster sample comprised 398 discrete villages.

<b> Sampling of Evaluation Households </b>

The data files described in this documentation correspond to a household sample survey carried out in three rounds (baseline in 2012, follow up 1 in 2013 and follow up 2 in 2014) with the objective of evaluating the impact of the Uganda Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE) programme in 14 pilot districts across the Eastern, Central, Western and Northen districts in Uganda. 

The impact evaluation has the following objectives:
- Assess the impact and operational effectiveness of the SAGE pilot programme.
- Compare the relative performance of the two targeting methodologies used in the pilot.

The evaluation assesses SAGE against its main objectives of empowering recipient households through:
- Reducing material deprivation
- Increasing economic security
- Reducing social exclusion
- Increasing access to services.

<b> What is the SAGE programme?</b> 

The SAGE programme transfer is currently worth UGX 25,000 per month and is paid every two months. This transfer is provided using electronic transfers. The two targeting methodologies being implemented are as follows:
- Vulnerable Family Support Grant (VFSG) - This employs a composite index based on demographic indicators of vulnerability to determine eligbility.
- Senior Citizen Grant (SCG) - This uses age to determine eligibility. 

Under the VFSG, if they are present in a beneficiary household, adult women are selected by the programme to be the physical recipient of transfers. In the case of SCG, the transfer is given to the specific older person enrolled.",econd Follow-up data collection-2014-09-2014-1,"The basic unit of analysis is at the household level.

- Community: community access to facilities, wages, local goods and prices.",Research Guide Africa,"<b> Overview </b>
In order to deliver the quantitative impact evaluation study design, a three-round longitudinal household panel survey was conducted. The quantitative survey was implemented in 398 clusters across 48 sub-counties in eight programme districts. The evaluation was conducted in eight of the 14 districts, in agreement with the programme. This was in order to minimise the operational burden of the evaluation on the programme, due to the requirement that the evaluation randomly assign targeting mechanisms between sub-counties within evaluation districts. Consequently, it was agreed to exclude from the evaluation the six 'new' districts that were created from the original districts when theadministrative boundaries were redrawn in 2010.

<b> Selection of Sub-counties </b>
Evaluation sub-counties were randomly selected from a list of sub-counties provided by the Uganda 2002 census. This list had to be adjusted to incorporate the 2010 sub-county boundary changes, with the populations of the new sub-counties provided by SAGE. The sample frame was thus comprised of the 74 sub-counties (as defined by the old administrative boundaries) in the eight programme evaluation districts, minus six that were excluded from selection for the evaluation.

Prior to selection, this list of 68 sub-counties was first randomly divided into two lists, one from which SCGsub-counties were drawn and one from which VFSG sub-counties were drawn. This random allocation of treatment was done to ensure a similar spread of sub-counties in both SCG and VFSG lists, allowing for rigorous comparison across the two targeting methodologies. The 24 SCG and 24 VFSG sub-counties to be covered by the evaluation were then randomly selected from the SCG and VFSG sub-county lists respectively. Sub-counties were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS).

The sampling of evaluation sub-counties had to account for the fact that in Karamoja only the SCG targeting mechanism was to be applied. To avoid sub-counties in the Karamoja region being over-represented in the SCG sub-county list, the list of VFSG sub-counties was not restricted to exclude those in the Karamoja region. Instead those Karamoja sub-counties that were randomly allocated to the VFSG sub-county list were then excluded, with the 24 VFSG evaluation sub-counties randomly selected from the restricted sub-county list.

<b> Selection of Evaluation Primary Sampling Units </b>
Within selected evaluation sub-counties a number of primary sampling units (PSUs) or clusters were drawn. The precise number of clusters depended on balancing a number of different factors: whether the unit was practically viable for use as a cluster for survey implementation; the population density of treatment and comparison households per cluster at the specified bandwidth; the number of clusters required at the specified bandwidth in order to achieve the proposed household sample size; and the number of clusters that it was financially viable to survey.

400 clusters (200 SCG; 200 VFSG) were randomly selected from across the 48 evaluation sub-counties, where the unit of cluster was the village, and using PPS based on the number of households within the bandwidth in each PSU. Due to the use of PPS and the relatively large size of a few villages compared to all the other villages, one SCG community was selected twice. Furthermore, during fieldwork it was found that two SCG communities in the sample frame that had been selected were in fact one community. This means that the final number of SCG communities is 198 and not 200, meaning that the final cluster sample comprised 398 discrete villages.

<b> Sampling of Evaluation Households </b>
From each of the 398 sampled villages, five treatment and five comparison group households were randomly selected for interview; with the exception of the two clusters that were sampled twice, from which 10 treatment and 10 comparison households were selected. In cases where insufficient treatment or comparison households were present within a particular village, the sample was re-distributed according to the following protocol:

- For low density villages that contain between six and nine evaluation households (i.e. treatment or comparison households within the evaluation bandwidth), replacements were taken from other sampled villages within the same sub-county. This was done by randomly selecting replacement households from the full list of households living in sampled evaluation villages in the same sub-county, that had not already been sampled. 
- In order to minimise the negative effect of the redistribution of sampled households between clusters on the logistics of the fieldwork, we restricted the total number of households to be interviewed within a particular village to a maximum of 12 households.
- Extremely low density villages containing less than six households within the bandwidth in total (either treatment or comparison) were dropped from the sample frame. Analysis of the most recent available SAGE MIS data from the six pre-pilot sub-counties shows that this represents only a very small proportionof beneficiaries and villages.

<b> Selection of Control Communities </b>
A sample of 100 control communities was also surveyed in order to measure impact on a selection of community-level outcomes. The control communities survey did not include a household survey. The control communities were identified using matching techniques, which match treatment and control communities using characteristics drawn from the 2002 Uganda Census. The control communities are located across six control districts, chosen using the same rationale as was used to select the 14 pilot programme districts, to obtain maximum comparability. The six control districts selected were: Nakasongola in the Central region; Kamuli and Buyende in the Eastern region; Pader and Agago in the Northern region; and Kamwenge in the Western region.",Face-to-face [f2f],"In each round there was a household questionnaire which was administered to each household and collected the household and individual level information. This contained modules on household characteristics, education, health, activities of the household members, migration, housing conditions, empowerment, assets, land and livestock,  subjective poverty, saving and borrowing, formal/informal transfers, hunger scale, consumption, operational and targeting, anthropometry. In addition a community questionnaire was conducted in each community.  This includes modules on communities access to facilities, wages, local goods and prices.","Weights were given by the inverse of the probability of being selected. The household's probability of selection was broken down into two component parts: 1) the probability of selection of the PSU; and 2) the probability of being selected into treatment and comparison groups from the list of all possible SAGE eligible and non-eligible households within the specified bandwidths in that PSU. In the calculation of the survey weights we ignored the probability associated with the selection of the evaluation sub-counties. Doing so reduces the variance of the final weights, thereby reducing the variance of point estimates and increasing the likelihood of detecting impact should the SAGE programme impact key outcome indicators. Furthermore, 48 out of a total 68 sub-counties have been included in the evaluation, meaning that the evaluation sample of sub-counties is already very representative of the total pilot population of sub-counties.

We defined the two component probabilities as follows:
<b> P1 </b>: Probability of a PSU being selected. PSUs were randomly selected using the PPS techniques separately for SCG and VFSG areas, drawn from a sample frame of all PSUs within evaluation sub-counties.
<b> P1 </b> = Number of households in bandwidth in PSU/total number of households in badwidth in evaluation sub-counties

<b> P2 </b>: Probability of being selected from the full list of treatment or comparison group households within a PSU (depending on whether household was a treatment or comparison household)
<b> P2 </b> = Number of sampled treatment or control households in PSU/total number of treatment or control households in PSU

The final probability of a household being selected for the SAGE baseline survey was calculated by combing <b> P1 </b> & <b> P2 </b>, as follows:
Probability of selection = <b> P1 x P2 </b>.

Thus, the final analytical weights applied to each household were constructed by taking the inverse of the probability of selection.","Merttens, Oxford Policy Management.

Between April and June 2015 UNHCR installed some three dozen community lights in 50% of Rhino Camp’s 14 villages. As demand for community lighting far exceeded available funds, UNHCR worked with the refugee community and its partner the Danish Refugee Council to prioritize the strategic placement of lights within villages. The partners jointly selected locations where (1) refugees were prone to nighttime violence, theft or other safety risks, and (2) lights would promote constructive night-time activity.

Using a 72-question survey, researchers asked respondents what day- and night-time6 activities they and their children do, and whether they do these activities in lit or unlit locations. Researchers then asked respondents if they feared or had been victims of something bad while doing these activities. The phrase something bad is the English translation for the most commonly used expressions – in Nuer, Dinka, Bari, and Kiswahili – of being a victim of an aggressive act or encountering danger.

The positive impact would affect refugees, host communities and hosting districts alike, thus moving towards social and economic integration. 

In August 2017, FAO was asked by the Commissioner for Refugees (Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda, OPM) to support the implementation of a socio-economic analysis within the refugees’ settlements and host communities, with the aim of providing a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the refugees’ food security, well-being and resilience. Although refugees in Uganda are given land and mobility rights, their food security remains low, with a high dependency on food aid. The assumption was that by better understanding refugees’ preferences and livelihoods strategies which determine their resilience, it would be possible to unlock the development potential of the land, increase productivity and help them achieve independence and self-reliance.

▪ National
▪ Urban and rural areas
▪ 15 regions
▪ Although they were not included as separate sampling domains, the overall sample size permitted estimates to be produced for the 14 ongoing indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention districts: Bugiri, Kaberamaido, Koboko, Lira, Otuke, Serere, Tororo, Alebtong, Amolatar, Budaka, Butaleja, Dokolo, Namutumba, and Paliisa and 11 former IRS intervention districts Oyam, Kole, Nwoya, Amuru, Agago, Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Omoro, Apac, and Lamwo.
▪ Refugee settlements in Adjumani, Arua, Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kiryandongo, Kyegegwa, Lamwo, Moyo, and Yumbe districts were included as a separate sampling domain.

The first stage of sampling involved selecting sample points (clusters) from the sampling frames; the nonrefugee areas and the refugee settlements used separate sampling frames. Enumeration areas (EAs) delineated for the 2014 National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) were used as the sampling frame for the non-refugee areas.A sampling frame developed for the National Refugees’ Survey, conducted by UBOS in collaboration with the World Bank and Office of the Prime Minister in early 2018, was used as the frame for the refugee settlement domain. A total of 320 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the 2014 NPHC. Of these clusters, 84 were in urban areas and 236 in rural areas. Urban areas were oversampled within regions in order to produce robust estimates for that domain. A total of 22 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the refugee frame.

The second stage of sampling involved systematic selection of households. For the non-refugee areas, a household listing operation was undertaken in all of the selected EAs in November and December 2018, and households to be included in the survey were randomly selected from these lists. In the selected clusters for the refugee settlements domain, listing was undertaken immediately before fieldwork in those clusters. Twenty-eight households were selected from each EA, for a total sample size of 8,878 households. Because of the approximately equal sample sizes in each domain, the sample was not selfweighting at the national level.

Note: See Appendix A of the final survey report for additional details on the sampling procedures.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Three questionnaires—the Household Questionnaire, the Woman’s Questionnaire, and the Biomarker Questionnaire—were used for fieldwork in the 2018-19 UMIS. Core questionnaires available from the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) were adapted to reflect the population and health issues relevant to Uganda. The modifications were decided upon at a series of meetings with various stakeholders from the NMCD and other government ministries and agencies, nongovernmental organisations, and international donors. The questionnaires were in English; UBOS arranged for translation into Luganda, Luo, Lugbara, Ateso, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were programmed onto tablet computers, enabling use of computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) for the survey. The Biomarker Questionnaire was filled out on hard copy and entered into the CAPI system when complete.

A fourth questionnaire, the Fieldworker Questionnaire, was adapted from The DHS Program’s standard questionnaire. It was completed by all fieldworkers in the 2018-19 UMIS; its purpose was to collect basic background information on the people who collect data in the field.","A spreadsheet containing all sampling parameters and selection probabilities was constructed to facilitate the calculation of sampling weights. Household sampling weights and individual sampling weights were calculated by adjusting the previous calculated weight to compensate household nonresponse and individual nonresponse, respectively.

The report also incorporates findings on needs among refugee and host community populations living in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The findings and analysis from this report has been used to support the Refugee Response Plan for 2019-2020, along with informing other programmatic, strategic, and operational decision making for the humanitarian response coordinators and partner organisations. The JMSNA aims to compare humanitarian needs across population groups and locations in order to highlight groups and areas of most concern. Consequently, it aims to answer the following research question: what is the situation for specific population groups (refugees residing within refugee settlements and host community populations) in Uganda regarding health and nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); livelihoods, environment and energy; shelter, site planning, and non-food items; education; and food security.

The JMSNA process in Uganda began in February 2018, with REACH facilitating the research design under the auspices of UNHCR and Uganda’s Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). Through the inter-agency coordination group and other coordination mechanisms, a collaborative tool was developed with input from many partners. Data collection was conducted from 2 April to 14 July, 2018, in all 30 refugee settlements. Data collection was carried out in Kampala from 6 to 16 March and 28 March to 9 April to assess the needs of refugee and host community households in vulnerable urban neighbourhoods of Kampala.

The primary objective of the 2018-19 UMIS is to provide up-to-date estimates of basic demographic and health indicators related to malaria. Specifically, the 2018-19 UMIS collected information on vector control interventions such as mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying of insecticides, on intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant women, on care seeking and treatment of fever in children, and malaria knowledge, behaviour, and practices. Children less than age 5 were tested for anaemia and malaria infection.

• Basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed in the household, including their age, sex, and relationship to the head of the household.
• Characteristics of the household's dwelling unit, such as the source of water, type of toilet facilities, number of rooms, type of fuel used for cooking, main material of the floor, roof and walls of the house, possessions of durable goods (including land), ownership of livestock, etc.

BIOMARKER
• Identification
• Hemoglobin measurement and malaria testing for children age 0-5",Uganda Bureau of Statistics,"The 2018-19 UMIS followed a two-stage sample design and was intended to allow estimates of key indicators for the following domains:
▪ National
▪ Urban and rural areas
▪ 15 regions
▪ Although they were not included as separate sampling domains, the overall sample size permitted estimates to be produced for the 14 ongoing indoor residual spraying (IRS) intervention districts: Bugiri, Kaberamaido, Koboko, Lira, Otuke, Serere, Tororo, Alebtong, Amolatar, Budaka, Butaleja, Dokolo, Namutumba, and Paliisa and 11 former IRS intervention districts Oyam, Kole, Nwoya, Amuru, Agago, Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Omoro, Apac, and Lamwo.
▪ Refugee settlements in Adjumani, Arua, Isingiro, Kamwenge, Kiryandongo, Kyegegwa, Lamwo, Moyo, and Yumbe districts were included as a separate sampling domain.

The first stage of sampling involved selecting sample points (clusters) from the sampling frames; the nonrefugee areas and the refugee settlements used separate sampling frames. Enumeration areas (EAs) delineated for the 2014 National Population and Housing Census (NPHC) were used as the sampling frame for the non-refugee areas.A sampling frame developed for the National Refugees’ Survey, conducted by UBOS in collaboration with the World Bank and Office of the Prime Minister in early 2018, was used as the frame for the refugee settlement domain. A total of 320 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the 2014 NPHC. Of these clusters, 84 were in urban areas and 236 in rural areas. Urban areas were oversampled within regions in order to produce robust estimates for that domain. A total of 22 clusters were selected with probability proportional to size from the EAs covered in the refugee frame.

The second stage of sampling involved systematic selection of households. For the non-refugee areas, a household listing operation was undertaken in all of the selected EAs in November and December 2018, and households to be included in the survey were randomly selected from these lists. In the selected clusters for the refugee settlements domain, listing was undertaken immediately before fieldwork in those clusters. Twenty-eight households were selected from each EA, for a total sample size of 8,878 households. Because of the approximately equal sample sizes in each domain, the sample was not selfweighting at the national level.

Note: See Appendix A of the final survey report for additional details on the sampling procedures.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Three questionnaires—the Household Questionnaire, the Woman’s Questionnaire, and the Biomarker Questionnaire—were used for fieldwork in the 2018-19 UMIS. Core questionnaires available from the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) were adapted to reflect the population and health issues relevant to Uganda. The modifications were decided upon at a series of meetings with various stakeholders from the NMCD and other government ministries and agencies, nongovernmental organisations, and international donors. The questionnaires were in English; UBOS arranged for translation into Luganda, Luo, Lugbara, Ateso, Runyankole/Rukiga, and Runyoro/Rutoro. The Household and Woman’s Questionnaires were programmed onto tablet computers, enabling use of computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) for the survey. The Biomarker Questionnaire was filled out on hard copy and entered into the CAPI system when complete.

A fourth questionnaire, the Fieldworker Questionnaire, was adapted from The DHS Program’s standard questionnaire. It was completed by all fieldworkers in the 2018-19 UMIS; its purpose was to collect basic background information on the people who collect data in the field.","A spreadsheet containing all sampling parameters and selection probabilities was constructed to facilitate the calculation of sampling weights. Household sampling weights and individual sampling weights were calculated by adjusting the previous calculated weight to compensate household nonresponse and individual nonresponse, respectively. These weights were further normalised at the national level to produce unweighted cases equal to weighted cases for both households and individuals at the national level. The normalised weights are valid for estimation of proportions and means at any aggregation levels, but not valid for estimation of totals.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

However, the recent refugee influx that doubled the number of refugees in the country in less than three years represents a challenge for the institutions, programs and mechanisms in place. The recent arrivals have put additional pressure on the public services delivery system, and to some central elements of the response approach, such as land availability for refugee use. The influx is also aggravated by the fact that refugee hosting areas were already vulnerable due to underlying poverty, limited resilience to shocks, limited capacity of local institutions, and low levels of human capital. Without the adequate response, the prolonged and steady refugee influx represents a challenge for the sustainability of Uganda’s approach.

Moreover, it is representative of the refugee and host population in the regions of West Nile and South West, and the city of Kampala. The host population is defined as the native population in districts where refugee settlements are situated. The survey used two different sampling frames. The first one, based on the list of Enumeration Areas (EAs) and the information of the 2014 Uganda Population and Housing Census, was used to determine the samples for the host and refugee populations of Kampala, and the host populations in West Nile and Southwest. The second one is a newly developed sampling frame for the refugee population in the West Nile and Southwest regions.

Given the nature of the survey, the sample is stratified by three separate domains. The first domain is the host population in the regions of West Nile and South West. The second is the refugee population in the regions of West Nile and Southwest, and the third, the refugee and host population in Kampala. A total of 221 primary sample units were allocated to the three different domains. For each domain, the sample was obtained based on a two-stage stratified sample of households. In the first stage, PSUs were selected using a Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling method. For the host communities and Kampala, before the selection of the PSUs, district EAs were sorted by residence type (urban/rural), district sub-county, parish, village and EAs. For Kampala, only EAs that contained more than ten refugee households according to the 2014 Census were considered. With this sorting and PPS for the selection of PSUs, implicit stratification by residence type was achieved. For the refugee settlements, EAs were sorted based on the Settlement, Zone, Block, Cluster, Village, EA and by dominant country of origin. The latter was intended to ensure that PSUs with refugees coming from different countries of origin were selected.

Between the first and second stages, a household listing operation was carried out in all selected PSUs outside Kampala. For the listing operation, all selected PSUs were visited and the residential households were located with their address and the name of the household head was recorded. In the second stage, for each selected PSU, ten households were selected from the newly established list using a systematic sampling approach. Household selection was performed in the field prior to the main survey and interviewers only interviewed selected households. This means that no replacements or changes to selected households was allowed in the implementation stage in order to prevent bias. With this design, the survey selected 2,209 residential households, distributed geographically across 13 districts of Uganda

Clusters are the primary sampling units and are constituted from enumeration areas (EA). The EA were defined in the 2002 General Population and Housing Census (RGPH) (SNR, 2005). 

These enumeration areas provided the master frame for the drawing of 250 clusters (187 rural and 63 urban), selected with a representative probability proportional to their size. Only 249 of these clusters were surveyed, because one cluster located in a refugee camp had to be eliminated from the sample. A strictly proportional sample allocation would have resulted in a very low number of urban households in certain provinces. It was therefore necessary to slightly oversample urban areas in order to survey a sufficient number of households to produce reliable estimates for urban areas. The second stage involved selecting a sample of households in these enumeration areas. In order to adequately guarantee the accuracy of the indicators, the total number drawn was limited to 30 households per cluster. Because of the nonproportional distribution of the sample among the different strata and the fact that the number of households was set for each cluster, weighting was used to ensure the validity of the sample at both national and provincial levels.

All women age 15-49 years who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed (7,528 women). In addition, a sample of men age 15-59 who were either usual residents of the selected household or visitors present in the household on the night before the survey were eligible for the survey (7,168 men). Finally, all women age 15-49 and all children under the age of five were eligible for the anemia and malaria diagnostic tests.

The sample for the 2007-08 RIDHS covered the population residing in ordinary households across the country. A national sample of 7,469 households (1,863 in urban areas and 5,606 in rural areas) was selected. The sample was first stratified to provide adequate representation from urban and rural areas as well as all the four provinces and the city of Kigali, the nation’s capital.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Three questionnaires were used in the 2007-08 RIDHS: the Household Questionnaire, the Women’s Questionnaire, and the Men’s Questionnaire. The content of these questionnaires was based on model questionnaires developed by the MEASURE DHS project.

Initial technical meetings that were held beginning in September 2007 allowed a wide range of government agencies as well as local and international organizations to contribute to the development of the questionnaires. Based on these discussions, the DHS model questionnaires were modified to reflect the needs of users and relevant issues in population, family planning, anemia, malaria and other health concerns in Rwanda. The questionnaires were then translated from French into Kinyarwanda. These questionnaires were finalized in December 2007 before the training of male and female interviewers.

The Household Questionnaire was used to list all of the usual members and visitors in the selected households. In addition, some basic information was collected on the characteristics of each person listed, including age, sex, education, and relationship to the head of the household. The main purpose of the Household Questionnaire was to identify women and men who were eligible for the individual interview. The Household Questionnaire also collected information on characteristics of the household’s dwelling unit such as the main source of drinking water, type of toilet facilities, materials used for the floor of the house, the main energy source used for cooking and ownership of various durable goods. Finally, the Household Questionnaire was also used to identify women and children eligible for the hemoglobin (anemia) and malaria diagnostic tests.

The Women’s Questionnaire was used to collect information on women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and covered questions on the following topics:
• Background characteristics
• Marital status
• Birth history
• Knowledge and use of family planning methods
• Fertility preferences
• Antenatal and delivery care
• Breastfeeding practices
• Vaccinations and childhood illnesses

The Men’s Questionnaire was administered to all men age 15-59 years living in the selected households. The Men’s Questionnaire collected information similar to that of the Women’s Questionnaire, with the only difference being that it did not include birth history or questions on maternal and child health or nutrition. In addition, the Men’s Questionnaire also collected information on circumcision.",Weighting was used to ensure the validity of the sample at both national and provincial levels.,"""National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, Rwanda Interim Demographic and Health Survey 2007-2008 (RIDHS 2008), v01, provided by the National Data Archive. http://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/13""",The NISR provides these data to external users without any warranty or responsibility implied.NISR accepts no responsability and/or implication of any action resulting from the use of these data.,https://microdata.unhcr.org/index.php/catalog/420,46;51;8;31,"child, nutrition, year, food, health, age, intervention, mother, disability, month;training, staff, consultant, program, activity, month, development, management, workshop, study;woman, gender, man, female, male, girl, youth, child, family, work;total, population, age, birth, year, fertility, percentage, people, net, growth",29.91967346,-1.99230766,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No

Only the refugees living in camps were surveyed, because tracing households outside the camps was not feasible. However, 66 percent of all refugees in Ethiopia live in camps, while those that live outside camps are largely Eritrean. Host communities, defined as Ethiopian non-displaced households living within a 5km radius of a camp, were also surveyed.",Sample survey data [ssd],NA,NA,"The SPS 2017 is a household survey with a multi-stage stratified random sample. The sampling frame was the list of refugee camps, sites and locations as of January 2017, provided by UNHCR-Ethiopia. The sample consisted of four strata based on four regions: Tigray Afar (Eritrean refugees), Gambella (South Sudanese refugees), Benishangul Gumuz (Sudanese refugees), and Somali (Somali refugees). Each region hosts predominantly one refugee nationality leading to an implicit stratification based on nationality. In each stratum, camps were divided into Enumeration Areas (EAs) of equal size using GIS technology, and 82 EAs were selected per stratum. Within the stratum, the number of EAs per camp was selected proportional to the size of the camp. Within camps, EAs were selected with equal probability. Within each selected EA, all households were listed and then 12 were randomly selected for interview. 

The host community sample consisted of the same four regional strata. Within each stratum, areas within a 5km radius of a camp, were divided into EAs of equal size. Of these EAs, those classified as 'residential' by Open Street Maps were used as the sampling frame. 42 EAs were selected per stratum. Within a stratum, EAs were selected using probability proportional to size, with the probability of selection of an EA corresponding to the area of the EA. Within each selected EA, all households were listed and then 12 were randomly selected for interview.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The questionnaire contains modules on Household Member Roster, Household Characteristics, Food Consumption, Non food consumption, Livestock, Durable Good, Wellbeing and Opinions and Forced Displacement, Movement and Return Intentions. The questionnaire is available for download with the dataset.","The sampling weight is the inverse probability of selection. The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. For refugees, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum, multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households, and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA (usually 12) divided by the total number of households listed in the EA. Sampling weights for refugees were scaled to equal the number of households per strata as per the sampling frame provided by UNHCR. Due to changes in the sample during fieldwork, the number of EAs surveyed in each stratum differed from the original sample. The weights were also scaled to correct for this change.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include: - the Identification of the Primary Investigator - the title of the survey (including country, acronym and year of implementation) - the survey reference number - the source and date of download.","The user of the data acknowledges that the original collector of the data, the authorized distributor of the data, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.",https://microdata.unhcr.org/index.php/catalog/400,39;13;60,"refugee, programme, country, migration, migrant, labour, remittance, population, international, asylum;household, poverty, poor, income, rural, high, inequality, access, low, population;community, village, district, project, group, local, people, activity, woman, area",39.60924823,8.614180692,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No

The influxes particularly from South Sudan, Burundi and DRC over the past 3 years currently renders Uganda the biggest host for refugees in Africa.

In order to efficiently offer adequate aid to these refugees, more and more humanitarian organizations and international non-governmental organizations have decided to convert in-kind support to cash-based transfers.

Uganda,UGA,2019,Community Perception Survey - 2019,384,HDX_GTS_UGA_2019_CPS_DDI_v1.1,HDX,Ground Truth Solutions,N/A,"This data includes responses to Ground Truth Solutions' perception survey conducted in October 2019 with 1511 refugees in Uganda. Both South Sudanese and Congolese refugees who have received aid and support from humanitarian organisations in the last 12 months are included.

Surveys were conducted in Adjumani (Nyumanzi, Baratuku, Elema), Bidibidi (Zone 1 and Zone 3), Imvepi (Zone I and Zone II), Kiryandongo (Ranch 1 and Ranch 37), Palorinya (Belemaling, Chinyi, Morobi), Rhino (Zone 2 – Omugo, Zone 3 - Ocea), Kyaka II (Byabakora, Kakoni, Mukondo), Kyangwali (Kirokole, Maratatu A, Maratatu B), Nakivale (Base Camp), and Rwamwanja (Base Camp, Kaihora, Nkoma).

Overall, the refugees surveyed view their relations with Ugandan locals and aid workers positively, saying they feel welcome in Uganda and treated with respect by humanitarian workers. 
Building on this positive relationship, communication between aid providers and refugees could be more open and robust. Currently, just over half of the refugees interviewed say they are able to provide feedback to humanitarian staff, and only a minority is aware of what assistance they are eligible to receive. Around half of the respondents feel that aid is unfairly distributed.

Refugees consider the aid received insufficient to meet their most important needs, so it is perhaps not surprising that they are also pessimistic about achieving self-reliance. Less than a quarter feel that their life prospects in Uganda are improving. While a clear majority points to the need for livelihood opportunities to strengthen their sense of self-reliance, three-quarters of respondents say they lack access to such opportunities. 

Almost everyone in our sample has been allocated land, and many consider it too small or not fertile enough, which is reflected in the high percentage of people (79%) who say they are dissatisfied with the land they have received. Refugees surveyed would appreciate more support from humanitarian actors when it comes to making decisions about returning to their countries of origin. Similarly, internal movement within Uganda and opportunities to migrate to a new country are areas in which refugees say they lack guidance from humanitarian agencies or other actors.",2019-10-08-2019-10-3,Individuals and households,N/A,Sample survey data [ssd],Admission and rights; emergency response and ongoing needs; resilience and self-reliance; expanded solutions; voluntary repatriation; demographics.,Ground Truth Solutions,"This survey is the third round of questions Ground Truth Solutions has asked in Uganda; the first round took place in 2017 and the second in 2018. As in previous rounds, respondents to the current round of questions have been selected randomly, but the respondents themselves are different from those in previous rounds. When designing the sampling strategy for this survey, we used the most recent figures for populations of refugees from the UNHCR refugee portal. Based on this data, we decided to focus on South Sudanese and Congolese refugees, as they made up 92% of all the refugees in Uganda at the time. Refugees from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia each made up 0-3% of the overall refugee population and were excluded from this study. This is not to say that the perspectives of more marginal groups are not important, but rather that gathering these perspectives was simply beyond the scope of our research in view of the geographical and time constraints involved. In terms of the locations selected, we decided to include Adjumani, Bidibidi, Imvepi, Kiryandongo, Kyaka II, Kyangwali, Nakivale, Palorinya, Rhino, and Rwamwanja (and to exclude Kampala, Lobule, Oruchinga, and Palabek), as over 90% of South Sudanese and Congolese refugees reside in these refugee settlements, according to UNHCR's most recent figures. 

The actual sample size achieved was 1,511 participants from 10 refugee settlements across Uganda, and the sample size in each settlement was proportional to the population size of the targeted communities within any given settlement. Using a confidence level of 95%, this sample size affords an expected margin of error of 3%. 

Ground Truth Solutions co-led enumerator training and supervised data collection on the ground. Within each of the 10 selected settlements, we chose particular zones from which to collect data, and within these zones, we selected smaller village/cluster units. In selecting the zones, we grouped them into two or three tiers, depending on the population size within the given zones of the camp, and asked the data collection partner to select one zone from each tier in order to capture responses from differently sized areas. Within the zones, a GTS supervisor, in consultation with local leaders and actors on the ground, selected the villages/clusters based on several factors, such as when they were established, their distance from central points, and their population size.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Survey questions were developed to help understand refugees’ perceptions of the aid they receive, their relationship with humanitarian workers and the host community, and their future prospects. For the purpose of comparing this data with previous rounds, the questions in this round are phrased similarly to those in rounds one and two wherever possible. We consulted local actors and organisations in Uganda for feedback and input during the survey question design phase. Draft questions were also presented to UNHCR, the Assessment Technical Working Group (ATWG), the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), and the Office of the Prime Minister. Additional questions around voluntary repatriation, migration to a different country, and moving within Uganda were introduced this year in order to cover voluntary repatriation as the fifth pillar of the Office of the Prime Minister’s Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework.

There are over 2.2 million refugees spread across Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and the Central African Republic (CAR) a further 1.8 million people are displaced internally in South Sudan. An estimated 140,000 South Sudanese spontaneously returnees are reported to have returned to South Sudan from November 2018 to date.

The South Sudan situation continues to be characterized as a children's tragedy with children constituting over 65 percent of the refugee population. The Revitalised Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) foresees the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU) with all the parties in agreement including the leader of the SPLA IO and first vice president by May 2019.

In November 2018, it was agreed during the Kampala Representatives meeting that intention surveys should be conducted for South Sudanese refugees in all countries of asylum. This was further concretized in March 2019, during the EHA/GLR planning meeting; here it was decided that UNHCR country representations of CAR, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Sudan, Ethiopia would ensure that a rapid intention survey of South Sudanese refugees in their respective asylum countries is carried out before May 2019, in line with the agreed calendar of the R-ARCSS

The Intention Survey was a cross-sectional survey conducted among the over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees living in six countries of asylum using a stratified random sampling approach to survey 6,964 refugees (heads of households) in 15 camps selected across the region. In each location, sample size estimation assumed a 95 per cent confidence level, and a margin of error of 7 per cent; sample was drawn taking into account the location, place of origin, ethnicity, year of arrival to the country of asylum and gender of the head of household.

This ambitious and important research is initially focused on three countries in East Africa – Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.
 
In order to glean insights into the remittance process in the three designated countries, the World Bank designed a two-phase survey process. Phase 1 involved conducting a national survey in each of the three countries. The purpose of the first phase of research was to collect a large representative sample of the adult population in each country. The national surveys provide important baseline data about international remittance flows including: an estimate of the percent of the total adult population that regularly receives remittances, the average amount of each remittance received, most common methods of receipt and top sending countries. Additionally, through the analysis of the national survey results, World Bank was able to identify areas of each country that have high concentrations of international remittance recipients. This important piece of information guided Phase 2 of the research – surveys of remittance receivers in each country. Whereas the national surveys aimed to collect general data about the remittance process, the surveys of remittance recipients allowed for the collection of more detailed data about the remittance process itself, how remittances are used, the relationship between sender and receiver, and interest in various financial products.
 
The results of this research will not only provide estimates of total annual amounts of remittances for each country, but also will tell us the percentage of the population in each country that is involved in the international remittance process. Furthermore, it will offer insights as to the degree to which Ethiopians, Kenyans and Ugandans depend on international remittances and how the money is used, saved and/or invested. Results will also measure interest in financial products that, if utilized, can significantly impact the financial well-being of the population and the overall economic stability of each country.",2010-07-2010-08; 2010-08-2010-0,"Households
Individuals",National Coverage,Sample survey data [ssd],NA,Bendixen & Amandi,"General:

The total samples were compiled utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling through respondent selection. Multi-stage random sampling ensured that a random sample of adults was collected in each country. First, after stratifying the population of each country by region and population density, sampling points (SPs) were determined. SPs were then randomly selected within each stratum. At each SP, respondents were randomly selected to participate in the survey.

Phase 1:

The first phase consisted of national surveys of the adult population of each country. The three survey samples were designed to be representative of the adult populations of these three countries. World Bank coordinated and oversaw all aspects of the sampling and interviewing process. A team of local field experts was hired in each country to conduct the actual interviews. All interviewers were professionally trained and supervised by research personnel. In this phase of the research, a total of 2042 Ethiopian adults were interviewed.

Phase 2:

Once the national surveys were completed, the results were analyzed to determine the areas of concentration of the remittance recipient population, after which the second phase of the project was conducted. This phase of the project included a targeted survey of the remittance recipient population of each of the three East African countries. Sampling Points were established based on the analysis of the national survey data and the identification of areas within each country that showed the highest concentrations of remittances received from relatives abroad in proportion to the sample size of all areas surveyed. Once again, local field experts were hired in each country to conduct the interviews, training and supervision of field operations. Languages of interviews were the same as those employed in Phase 1 and, again, all interviews were conducted in person using the PAPI method. A total of 400 interviews with regular international remittance recipients were completed in each country during August and September of 2010. The margin of error for all three surveys is approximately ±5 percentage points and the 95 percent level of confidence.

Detail:

The total sample was compiled utilizing multi-stage stratified random sampling through respondent selection. This sampling method enabled B&A to ensure that a representative random sample of Ethiopian adults was collected. There are three stages to this type of sampling methodology. First, after stratifying the Ethiopian population by region and population density, sampling points (SPs) were determined. SPs were then randomly selected within each stratum. In the second stage, using the random route method, dwellings were selected within each SP. The random route method involves selecting an address in each SP at random as a starting point. Each interviewer was given instructions to identify additional dwellings by taking alternate left and right turns and stopping at every Nth dwelling. The third and final stage involved selecting actual participants - for each selected dwelling, individual respondents were chosen using a Kish grid. In a Kish grid, prior to beginning the interview, the interviewer first asks for the ages and genders of every household member (only persons aged 18 or older were eligible for selection). The individual to be
interviewed was then chosen based on a random number in the grid.

Once the national survey was completed, B&A analyzed the results to determine the areas of concentration of the remittance recipient population, after which the second phase of the project was conducted. This phase included a targeted survey of the remittance recipient population in Ethiopia. Sampling Points  were established based on B&A's analysis of the national survey data and the identification of areas of the country that showed concentrations of international remittance receivers in proportion to the sample size of all areas surveyed. Once again, local field experts were hired to conduct the interviews and B&A conducted all training and supervision of field operations. Interviews were conducted in Amharic and all interviews were conducted in person using the PAPI method. A total of 410 interviews with regular international remittance recipients were conducted in Ethiopia during August and September of 2010. The margin of error for the surveys is approximately ±5 percentage points and the 95 percent level of confidence.",Face-to-face [f2f],"Phase 1:

This survey consisted of 12 questions that were aimed at helping to identify some of the basic characteristics of the remittance recipient population in each country. Some of the variables included in this survey were – location, age, gender, amount of money received, method of receipt, origin of remittance, etc. 

Phase 2:

The survey instrument for Phase 2 consisted of approximately 35 questions and included a number of variables aimed at obtaining greater detail about the remittance receiving process including costs, amounts received, information about the sender and the relationship between sender and receiver. Additionally, the survey measured interest in various financial products.","As is the case with most surveys conducted in areas that have significant rural populations, there was some over-representation of people who reside in urban areas. The national data was therefore weighted to be consistent with the most recent official statistics available showing the
breakdown of the urban/rural population in Ethiopia – 16% urban and 84% rural.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:

Only the refugees living in camps were surveyed, because tracing households outside the camps was not feasible. However, 66 percent of all refugees in Ethiopia live in camps, while those that live outside camps are largely Eritrean. Host communities, defined as Ethiopian non-displaced households living within a 5km radius of a camp, were also surveyed.",Sample survey data [ssd],NA,NA,"The SPS 2017 is a household survey with a multi-stage stratified random sample. The sampling frame was the list of refugee camps, sites and locations as of January 2017, provided by UNHCR-Ethiopia. The sample consisted of four strata based on four regions: Tigray Afar (Eritrean refugees), Gambella (South Sudanese refugees), Benishangul Gumuz (Sudanese refugees), and Somali (Somali refugees). Each region hosts predominantly one refugee nationality leading to an implicit stratification based on nationality. In each stratum, camps were divided into Enumeration Areas (EAs) of equal size using GIS technology, and 82 EAs were selected per stratum. Within the stratum, the number of EAs per camp was selected proportional to the size of the camp. Within camps, EAs were selected with equal probability. Within each selected EA, all households were listed and then 12 were randomly selected for interview. 

The host community sample consisted of the same four regional strata. Within each stratum, areas within a 5km radius of a camp, were divided into EAs of equal size. Of these EAs, those classified as 'residential' by Open Street Maps were used as the sampling frame. 42 EAs were selected per stratum. Within a stratum, EAs were selected using probability proportional to size, with the probability of selection of an EA corresponding to the area of the EA. Within each selected EA, all households were listed and then 12 were randomly selected for interview.",Computer Assisted Personal Interview [capi],"The questionnaire contains modules on Household Member Roster, Household Characteristics, Food Consumption, Non food consumption, Livestock, Durable Good, Wellbeing and Opinions and Forced Displacement, Movement and Return Intentions. The questionnaire is available for download with the dataset.","The sampling weight is the inverse probability of selection. The selection probability for a household can be decomposed into the selection probability of the EA within the stratum, and the selection probability of the household within the EA. For refugees, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of households within the EA divided by the number of households within the stratum, multiplied by the number of selected EAs in the stratum. For the host community, the selection probability of an EA is calculated as the number of EAs selected per stratum divided by the total number of EAs in the stratum. The selection probability for a household within an EA is constant across households, and is calculated as the number of households selected in the EA (usually 12) divided by the total number of households listed in the EA. Sampling weights for refugees were scaled to equal the number of households per strata as per the sampling frame provided by UNHCR. Due to changes in the sample during fieldwork, the number of EAs surveyed in each stratum differed from the original sample. The weights were also scaled to correct for this change.","Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include: - the Identification of the Primary Investigator - the title of the survey (including country, acronym and year of implementation) - the survey reference number - the source and date of download.","The user of the data acknowledges that the original collector of the data, the authorized distributor of the data, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.",https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3445,39;13;60,"refugee, programme, country, migration, migrant, labour, remittance, population, international, asylum;household, poverty, poor, income, rural, high, inequality, access, low, population;community, village, district, project, group, local, people, activity, woman, area",39.60924823,8.614180692,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No
