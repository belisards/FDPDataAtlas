# FDPDataAtlas for mapping gaps in micro-level data on forcibly displaced people

This package is a variant of the [original eviatlas package](https://github.com/ESHackathon/eviatlas) and created to visualize data gaps in micro-level data on forcibly displaced people (FDP). To launch an app, you need to run the following:

```
library(devtools)
install()
```
Once done, you can then run server.R in inst/eviatlas.
